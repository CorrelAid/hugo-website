# How to support CorrelAid?

Our network provides different possibilities to network and get active. Become a part of it!

## Help non-profit organizations

The core task of our work is connecting NGOs with our network of data analysts. In teams of 3-7 people, we help NGos to gain insight into their own data and leverage the results. 
Project announcements are sent out via our [distribution list](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff), this is why you should be part of it!

If you are in contact with a NGO that holds some fascinating data, without quite knowing how to make use of it, send an e-mail to [Arndt](mailto:arndt.l@correlaid.org). 
If you already have experience in Analytics Consulting and you want to help us with our project work, write an e-mail to [Johannes](mailto:johannes.m@correlaid.org).

## Exchange and Network

We meet once or twice a year in a different city in Germany and everybody is very welcome to these meetings. Berlin, Duisburg, Bonn: during workshops, discussions and bar-hopping, you will meet many others interested in the same topics as you.

We also try to establish local chapters in cities where the interest in Data-for-Good projects is present. The advantage is that you can start conducting your own workshops, hackathons, projects with local NGOs and to meet on a regular basis.
If you are interested in starting a local chapter yourself, or if you want to know if there are people around you also interested in staring this, write an e-mail to [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org). You can find all current local chapters and points of contact [here](/en/correlaid-x).

Our network is the perfect place for knowledge exchange. In workshops during our meetups, people share their knowledge and experience and in our #netzwerk-help channel, you have the possibility to ask your questions. We also plan to have a series of webinars in the future and a knowledge database. 
Whether you want to share your knowledge or you are looking for answers - both is possible in the CorrelAid Network!

## Create awareness for Data-for-Good

You are working on an interesting data project and want to share your results with a wider audience? You are part of interesting events and want to share your experience? Write a blogpost about it and contact [Lisa](mailto:blog@correlaid.org)!

You have information on hackathons, discussion-roundtables, events, articles, movements trends regarding data and data analysis? [Rahel](mailto:newsletter@correlaid.org) is always happy to get input for the CorrelAid Newsletter!

## Organize CorrelAid 

CorrelAid works with the help and commitment of 10-15 volunteers. Everyday business and coordination is done via slack and we are always happy to welcome new people! If you want to get active, write an e-mail to [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org)!
