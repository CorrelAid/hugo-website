## You think your organization does not work with data? Well, think again…

The organizations which we have previously collaborated with come from various backgrounds: social work with children or the elderly, political rights activists and advocates for migrant communites or disabled people but also sport clubs and associations for recreational activities. At first glance, you might think that these organizations do not work with data in their eveyday business and therefore cannot really profit from collaborating with CorrelAid. This perspective relates to the problem that many people cannot really imagine what data basically is and how data scientists work with it.

Thinking about data, may people think about long Excel tables and boring afternoons in the office. However, by definition data refers to information. If a sufficiently large amount of information is collected, data scientists can observe, analyse and predict patterns and trends.
EXAMPLE PLEASE

If your organization works with digital formats of the information necessary to keep the daily operations running, it is highly likely that it works with data.
