# Workshops & Education

At CorrelAid e.V., we are not only committed to the idea of data for good, but also firmly believe in sharing knowledge. This is why "education" has become our legal purpose. We offer a wide range of educational formats for nonprofits and volunteers. In addition, we share our knowledge, code and other material publicly whenever data protection guidelines allow us to do so.

## Newsletter
In our newsletter for NPOs, we share insights into our work and short introductions into 
topics like impact measurement, data collection and data analysis.

## Workshops
### Impact measurement
In this course, participants learn how social organizations develop impact chains and impact indicators. During the workshop we will work with illustrative examples, directly transferable instruments, jointly design impact chains and talk about the current state of impact measurement in Germany.

**Learning objectives:**
- The participants explore their goals and intentions for impact measurement
- The participants develop their own impact chain
- The participants select impact indicators

### Data strategy
In this course, participants learn how data and technology enable evidence-based and completely new ways of working. We will present case studies from our work, give an introduction to tools that social organizations can use to develop their own data strategy and conduct initial data analyses. 

**Learning objectives:**
- Participants have an understanding of the potential of data and data analysis in general.
- Participants are able to recognize the potential and potential obstacles of data analysis in their organizations.
- Participants can perform simple data analyses and create visualizations.
- Participants know where to go and how to get help with data for their organization.
