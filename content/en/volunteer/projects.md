description: "Data visualization, automation, modelling, data management consulting: In our Data4Good projects, we connect you and your team mates with a social organization in need of support of data analysts. At the same time, the projects give you the opportunity to apply and expand your skills and connect with other socially-driven data folks. Our projects are open to everyone regardless of background and pre-existing data  skills."

At the core of our work are our skilled volunteering projects in which we connect data analysts from our network with non-profit organisations (NPO). In our projects, you have the opportunity to apply your skills to the real problems our partner organisations face. In a team with 2-6 other people, you'll help your partner NPO to gain insight into their own data and leverage the results. Depending on the month, 1-4 projects start per month.

For each project, a call for applications is published via our e-mail newsletter. The application is then open to all data analysts of our network and you can apply for all the projects you find interesting.



## Your involvement

- 2-6 months, ca. 4 hours per week
- typically remote collaboration over Slack and Zoom
- work with open source technologies like R, Python, and Git/GitHub
