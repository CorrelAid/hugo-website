description: "Founded in a small town in southern Germany, CorrelAid has always been a remote-first network. A lot of our activities are accessible to anyone with a decent internet connection: our active Slack community, regular online workshops and meetups, a mentoring programme, our annual CorrelCon, and most of our Data4Good projects."
