What I enjoyed most, was publishing a new version of our dashboard. Usually, this happened on Sunday evenings, after a weekend of programming and implementing new ideas. I've learned a lot from my teammates and our partners at GoVolunteer during the project: Not only did I improve my coding skills in R, but I also learned how to do effective project work in a vivid virtual team.
