# How to support CorrelAid?

Our network provides different possibilities to network and get active. Become a part of it!

## Help non-profit organizations

The core task of our work is connecting NGOs with our network of data analysts. In teams of 3-7 people, we help NGos to gain insight into their own data and leverage the results. 
Project announcements are sent out via our [distribution list](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff), this is why you should be part of it!

If you are in contact with a NGO that holds some fascinating data, without quite knowing how to make use of it, send an e-mail to [Arndt](mailto:arndt.l@correlaid.org). 
If you already have experience in Analytics Consulting and you want to help us with our project work, write an e-mail to [Johannes](mailto:johannes.m@correlaid.org).

## Exchange and Network

We meet once or twice a year in a different city in Germany and everybody is very welcome to these meetings. Berlin, Duisburg, Bonn: during workshops, discussions and bar-hopping, you will meet many others interested in the same topics as you.

We also try to establish local chapters in cities where the interest in Data-for-Good projects is present. The advantage is that you can start conducting your own workshops, hackathons, projects with local NGOs and to meet on a regular basis.
If you are interested in starting a local chapter yourself, or if you want to know if there are people around you also interested in staring this, write an e-mail to [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org). You can find all current local chapters and points of contact [here](/en/correlaid-x).

Our network is the perfect place for knowledge exchange. In workshops during our meetups, people share their knowledge and experience and in our #netzwerk-help channel, you have the possibility to ask your questions. We also plan to have a series of webinars in the future and a knowledge database. 
Whether you want to share your knowledge or you are looking for answers - both is possible in the CorrelAid Network!

## Create awareness for Data-for-Good

You are working on an interesting data project and want to share your results with a wider audience? You are part of interesting events and want to share your experience? Write a blogpost about it and contact [Lisa](mailto:blog@correlaid.org)!

You have information on hackathons, discussion-roundtables, events, articles, movements trends regarding data and data analysis? [Rahel](mailto:newsletter@correlaid.org) is always happy to get input for the CorrelAid Newsletter!

## Organize CorrelAid 

CorrelAid works with the help and commitment of 10-15 volunteers. Everyday business and coordination is done via slack and we are always happy to welcome new people! If you want to get active, write an e-mail to [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org)!


## Doing data4good projects

Our data4good projects are probably the main reason why you are thinking about joining CorrelAid. You want to use your skills for the social good? Excellent, you've come to the right place, we've done over 40 projects so far and are constantly talking to new organizations to organize more projects.

It is important to understand that at CorrelAid, there's **no fixed pool of data analysts** who have prioritized access to the projects: There's no secret club of CorrelAid data scientists who exclusively get to work on our data4good projects. Instead, **applications are collected on a per-project basis**. Project call for applications are sent out to our **newsletter email list** and you can **then apply for a specific project** that you consider interesting. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
There's no need to apply to our info mail with a CV or anything. Just sign up for our [newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff) and you'll get all opportunities straight to your inbox. 
{% endhint %}

So the only thing you need to do to join a CorrelAid data4good project is [sign up for the newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff) and wait until a cool project comes around! Depending on the month, we start 1-4 projects per month. 

Sign up for our newsletter [here](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff).

## Connect with other data analysts

### CorrelAidX

If you want to network with other data scientists, consider joining one of our CorrelAidX chapters. While CorrelAid is a remote organisation, we also have local chapters that meet in-person regularly. You can find all local chapters along with contact addresses on our [website](https://correlaid.org/en/correlaid-x/). If you want to start your own chapter, feel free to reach out to [Regina](mailto:regina.s@correlaid.org).

### Slack

Regardless of whether a local chapter is close to you or not, you can always request to join our [Slack](wiki/communication/slack.md#i-want-to-get-access-to-slack-how-do-i-get-it) to find community there. 

## Get involved in the core team

The core team is the organizational team of CorrelAid which keeps us running. From organizing projects and creating educational content to writing grant applications - there is loads to do. The core team is divided into different subteams:

* **project coordination team**: the project coordination team coordinates the data4good projects, i.e. they talk to the organization, find out how we can help them and sends out the project call for applications. They usually _do not actively code_ for the projects. Relevant Slack channels: \#projects, and a private channel you will be added to if you're interested in becoming a project coordinator.
* **education team**: this team creates educational content and organizes projects that benefit our network members. They also aim to create content for NPOs about data organization and simple data analysis skills. Finally, our Podcast [CorrelTalk](https://www.spreaker.com/show/correltalk-the-correlaid-podcast) is  produced by members of the education team. Relevant Slack channels: \#education, \#podcast. 
* **PR team**: from filling our blog to posting on social media to designing stickers and other [CorrelAid merch](wiki/correlaid-merch.md). The PR team is responsible for everything that represents CorrelAid to the outside. Relevant channels: \#pr, \#pr-team. 
* **fundraising team**: the fundraising team looks out for funding opportunities for CorrelAid, collaborates with other organizations on grant proposals etc. Relevant Slack channels: \#fundraising.
* **infrastructure team**: the infrastructure team takes care of our hugo website, our cloud resources, the CorrelAid Slackbot, the self-hosted [CodiMD](wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md) and the administration of our NextCloud instance [CorrelCloud](wiki/infrastructure/correlcloud.md). They also actively develop said tools - especially CodiMD and the website - so if you're a \(JS / Python / Frontend\) developer, this is the right place to get involved! ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» 

If you want to be involved in the core team, it's best to do the following:

1. Write an email to [Frie](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org) explaining where you'd like to participate. You'll then get an invite to our [Slack](wiki/communication/slack.md). 
2. You'll probably also need an [CodiMD](wiki/infrastructure/codimd.md) account later on.
