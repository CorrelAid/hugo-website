# Volunteering at CorrelAid

Our network provides different possibilities to network and get active for data4good. Become a part of it!

## Help non-profit organizations

The core task of our work is connecting NGOs with our network of data analysts. In teams of usually 2-7 people, we help NPos to gain insight into their own data and leverage the results. 

It is important to understand that at CorrelAid, there's no fixed pool of data analysts who have prioritized access to the projects: There's no secret club of CorrelAid data scientists who exclusively get to work on our data4good projects. Instead, applications are collected on a per-project basis. Project call for applications are sent out to our [email newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff) and you can then apply for those projects that you consider interesting. Depending on the month, we start 1-4 projects per month.

If you are in contact with a NPO that holds some fascinating data, without quite knowing how to make use of it, send an e-mail to [Frie](mailto:projekte@correlaid.org). 
If you already have experience in analytics consulting and you want to help us to improve our project work, write an e-mail to [Johannes](mailto:johannes.m@correlaid.org).

## Exchange and Network

### Annual data4good conference
We meet once or twice a year in a different city in Germany for our data4good mini-conference (also known as "the meetup"). Everybody - regardless of experience or background - is very welcome at these meetings. Berlin, Duisburg, Bonn, Hamburg, Mannheim: during workshops, discussions and bar-hopping, you will meet many others interested in the same topics as you. You can read about experiences at past meetups [here](en/blog/meetup-berlin/), [here](en/blog/meetup-hh/), [here](en/blog/meetup-bonn/) and [here](/en/blog/meetup-mannheim/). 

### CorrelAidX: data4good on the local level
With our program CorrelAidX, we have also established local chapters in several German cities, the Netherlands and Paris. The advantage is that you can start conducting your own workshops, hackathons, projects with local NGOs and to meet on a regular basis. You can find all existing CorrelAidX chapters and points of contact [here](/en/correlaid-x).
If you are interested in starting a local chapter yourself, or if you want to know if there are people around you also interested in starting this, write an e-mail to our Head of Community Management [Isabel](mailto:isabel.w@correlaid.org). 

### Slack community
Regardless of whether a local chapter is close to you or not, you can always request to join our active Slack community to connect to other like-minded data scientists, find support for your problems in the #help channel and get a more closer insight into the workings of CorrelAid.

## Create awareness for Data-for-Good

You are working on an interesting data project and want to share your results with a wider audience? You are part of interesting events and want to share your experience? We're always happy to feature contributions from the CorrelAid community on our blog. Just write an email to [Yannik](mailto:blog@correlaid.org) and he'll support you in the process.

You have information on hackathons, discussion-roundtables, events, articles, movements trends regarding data and data analysis? [Rahel](mailto:newsletter@correlaid.org) is always happy to get input for the CorrelAid Newsletter!

## Organize CorrelAid 

The core team is a team of ~30 volunteers who keep CorrelAid running. From organizing projects and creating educational content to writing grant applications - there is loads to do. The core team is divided into different subteams: 

* **project coordination team**: the project coordination team coordinates the data4good projects, i.e. they talk to the organization, find out how we can help them and sends out the project call for applications. Over the course of the project, coordinators keep an eye on the project to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
* **education team**: this team creates educational content and organizes projects that benefit our network members. They also aim to create content for NPOs about data organization and simple data analysis skills. Finally, our Podcast [CorrelTalk](https://www.spreaker.com/show/correltalk-the-correlaid-podcast) is  produced by members of the education team. Relevant Slack channels: \#education, \#podcast. 
* **PR team**: from filling our blog to posting on social media to designing stickers and other CorrelAid merch. The PR team is responsible for everything that represents CorrelAid to the outside. Relevant channels: \#pr, \#pr-team. 
* **fundraising team**: the fundraising team looks out for funding opportunities for CorrelAid, collaborates with other organizations on grant proposals etc. Relevant Slack channels: \#fundraising. 
* **infrastructure team**: the infrastructure team takes care of our hugo website, our cloud resources, the CorrelAid Slackbot, the self-hosted CodiMD and the administration of our NextCloud instance CorrelCloud. They also actively develop said tools - especially CodiMD and the website - so if you're a Hugo / JS / Python / Frontend developer, this is the right place to get involved! 

If you want to get active, write an e-mail to [info@correlaid.org](mailto:info@correlaid.org) - either Frie or Isabel will reply you soon afterwards. If you want to help but are not sure how, please don't hesistate to send an email out to our community manager [Isabel](isabel.w@correlaid.org).
