What I enjoyed most, was publishing a new version of our dashboard. Usually, this happened on Sunday evenings, after a weekend of programming and implementing new ideas. I've learned a lot from my teammates and our partners at GoVolunteer during the project: Not only did I improve my coding skills in R, but I also learned how to do effective project work in a vivid virtual team.

# CorrelAidX: Data4Good on the local level


### CorrelAidX: Data4Good on the local level
With our program CorrelAidX, we have also established local chapters in several German cities, the Netherlands and Paris. The advantage is that you can start conducting your own workshops, hackathons, projects with local NGOs and to meet on a regular basis. You can find all existing CorrelAidX chapters and points of contact [here](/en/correlaid-x).
If you are interested in starting a local chapter yourself, or if you want to know if there are people around you also interested in starting this, write an e-mail to our Head of Community Management [Phil](mailto:phil.b@correlaid.org).
