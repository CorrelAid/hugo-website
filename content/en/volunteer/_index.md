# Volunteering at CorrelAid

Our network provides different possibilities to network and get active for Data4Good. Become a part of our community!

## Help non-profit organizations

At the core of our work are our skilled volunteering projects in which we connect data analysts from our network with non-profit organisations (NPO). In our projects, volunteers have the opportunity to apply their skills to the real problems our partner organisations face. In teams of usually 2-7 people, CorrelAid data scientists help NPOs to gain insight into their own data and leverage the results. Depending on the month, 1-4 projects start per month. 

For each project, a call for applications is published via our [e-mail newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff). The application is then open to all data analysts of our network and you can apply for all the projects you find interesting. 

If you are in contact with a NPO that holds some fascinating data, without quite knowing how to make use of it, let our project coordination team know by contacting [Frie](mailto:projekte@correlaid.org). 
If you already have experience in doing data science projects and you want to help us to improve our project work, write an e-mail to [Johannes](mailto:johannes.m@correlaid.org).

## Exchange and Network

### Annual Data4Good conference
We meet once or twice a year in a different city in Germany for our Data4Good mini-conference (also known as "the meetup"). Everybody - regardless of experience or background - is very welcome at these meetings. Berlin, Duisburg, Bonn, Hamburg, Mannheim: during workshops, discussions and bar-hopping, you will meet many others interested in the same topics as you. You can read about experiences at past meetups [here](/en/blog/meetup-berlin/), [here](/en/blog/meetup-hh/), [here](/en/blog/meetup-bonn/) and [here](/en/blog/meetup-mannheim/). 

### CorrelAidX: Data4Good on the local level
With our program CorrelAidX, we have also established local chapters in several German cities, the Netherlands and Paris. The advantage is that you can start conducting your own workshops, hackathons, projects with local NGOs and to meet on a regular basis. You can find all existing CorrelAidX chapters and points of contact [here](/en/correlaid-x).
If you are interested in starting a local chapter yourself, or if you want to know if there are people around you also interested in starting this, write an e-mail to our Head of Community Management [Isabel](mailto:isabel.w@correlaid.org).

### Slack community
Regardless of whether a local chapter is close to you or not, you can always request to join our active Slack community to connect to other like-minded data scientists, find support for your problems in the #help channel and get a more closer insight into the workings of CorrelAid.

## Organize CorrelAid 

The core team is a team of ~30 volunteers who keep CorrelAid running. From organizing projects and creating educational content to writing grant applications - there is loads to do. The core team is divided into different subteams: 

* **education team**: this team creates educational content and organizes educational projects that benefit our network members. They also aim to create content for NPOs about data organization and simple data analysis skills. Finally, our Podcast [CorrelTalk](https://soundcloud.com/correlaid_podcast) is  produced by members of the education team. Relevant Slack channels: \#education, \#podcast. 
* **project coordination team**: the project coordination team coordinates the Data4Good projects, i.e. they talk to the organization, find out how our data scientist volunteers could help them and send out the project call for applications. Over the course of the project, coordinators keep an eye on the project to ensure that everything goes smoothly.
* **PR team**: from filling our blog to posting on social media to designing stickers and other CorrelAid merch. The PR team is responsible for everything that represents CorrelAid to the outside. Relevant channels: \#pr, \#pr-team. 
* **fundraising team**: the fundraising team looks out for funding opportunities for CorrelAid, collaborates with other organizations on grant proposals etc. Relevant Slack channels: \#fundraising. 
* **infrastructure team**: the infrastructure team takes care of our hugo website, our cloud resources, the CorrelAid Slackbot, the self-hosted CodiMD and the administration of our NextCloud instance CorrelCloud. They also actively develop said tools - especially CodiMD and the website - so if you're a Hugo / JS / Python / Frontend developer, this is the right place to get involved! 

If you want to get active in the core team, write an e-mail to [info@correlaid.org](mailto:info@correlaid.org) - either Frie or Isabel will reply you soon afterwards. If you want to help but are not sure how, please don't hesistate to send an email out to our community manager [Isabel](isabel.w@correlaid.org).


# Confused?
Do you want to learn more about how you can get involved at CorrelAid? Or you don't know yet what's right for you? You can always arrange an informal meeting with our Community Manager Isabel.
