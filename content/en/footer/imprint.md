### Scope of application

The Privacy Policy contains information about the nature, purpose and extent of the processing of personal data by the responsible operator of this website. The legal basis for this is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Telemedia Act (TMG).

### General information about privacy

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. The use of our website is usually possible without explicit indication of personal data.

As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) are processed, this processing takes place exclusively on basis of a legal permission or with your express consent. Your data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit consent.

Please note, however, that data transmission over the internet (for example, when communicating via e-mail) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data from access by third parties is therefore not possible. You should also be aware that by publicly sharing images, comments, or similar material on our sites, unknown third parties may copy and distribute this information on other sites. As a result, shared information can still be found on the internet after it has been deleted from our site.

### Newsletter

We curate two newsletters as part of our work. 

#### Processed data and purpose of processing: Newsletter for Nonprofits
If you subscribe to the newsletter for nonprofits on our website, we use your email address, first and last name to send you the newsletter regularly and to provide you with updates about CorrelAids activities.

Optionally, you can share more data with us in the [subscription form](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/257414/78742752988235359/share) and give us consent to process it for certain additional purposes:

- For the purpose of compiling anonymous user statistics so that we can learn more about our target audience: organization's website and field of activity.

We do not use tracking in our newsletter emails.

#### Processed data and purpose of processing: Newsletter for volunteers.
If you subscribe to the newsletter on our website, we use your email address, first and last name, and your (optional) choice of CorrelAidX chapters to send you the newsletter regularly, to provide you with updates about CorrelAid, its activities and (optional) activities in your region.

Optionally, you can share more data with us in the [registration form](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/257414/78748110521631819/share) and give us consent to process it for certain additional purposes:

- For the purpose of informing you about newly created or reactivated CorrelAidX chapters and updates about their future activities: city and country of residence
- For the purpose of compiling anonymous user statistics so that we can learn more about our target audience: Gender, year of birth, city and country of residence.

We do not use tracking in our newsletter emails.

#### Legal basis for data processing, revocation of consent, etc.

The **legal basis** for sending the newsletter and the other optional purposes described is your consent (Article 6(1) 1a) GDPR). 

**Tool**: We use [MailerLite](https://mailerlite.com), a tool from MailerLite Limited, Ground Floor, 71 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2, D02 P593, Ireland, to store the data and send the newsletter. We have entered into an data processing agreement with MailerLite Limited. 

**Transfer to Third Countries**: Your data is not transfered to third countries. 

**Duration**: The data stored by us for the purposes described above will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter. Then, your data will be deleted from both our servers and the servers of MailerLite. Data stored by us for other purposes (e.g. e-mail addresses of members of CorrelAid e.V.) remain unaffected by this. 

**Revocation of consent option**: You have the option to revoke your consent to the processing of your data with effect for the future at any time.
To do so, you can click on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any newsletter email. The email address you provided for sending the newsletter, as well as all other data you shared with us in the registration form, will be deleted as soon as you revoke your consent to receive the newsletter, unless the data is also used for other communication than for sending the newsletter between us and you (e.g. if you are a member of CorrelAid e.V.).  The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. 

**More data protection information**: We would like to point out that cookies are used on MailerLite's websites and that personal data is thus processed by MailerLite, its partners and service providers used (e.g. Google Analytics). We have no influence on this data processing. Further information can be found in the [Privacy Policy of MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/legal/privacy-policy).

### Facebook social plug-in

Facebook will be informed via the plug-in that you have accessed the corresponding website of our offer. This also applies to users who are not registered with Facebook. In this case, there is the possibility that Facebook stores the IP address.

If you are a member of Facebook and logged in, the call of a website with Facebook plug-in can be clearly assigned to your user account on Facebook. In addition, the plug-ins transmit all interactions, for example, if you use the Like button or leave a comment.

To prevent Facebook from storing information about you, please log out of Facebook before visiting our websites. You can also block the plug-ins with add-ons for the browser (for example, "Facebook Blocker").

### Right to information, correction, suspension, cancellation and opposition

You can ask for information about the data we have stored about you at any time. You may request a correction, blocking or deletion of your data.
