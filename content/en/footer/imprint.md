Unless expressly permitted by law (§ 44a et seq. of the copyright law), every form of utilizing, reproducing or processing works subject to copyright protection on our web pages requires the prior consent of the respective owner of the rights.

### Scope of application

The Privacy Policy contains information about the nature, purpose and extent of the processing of personal data by the responsible operator of this website. The legal basis for this is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Telemedia Act (TMG).

### General information about privacy

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. The use of our website is usually possible without explicit indication of personal data.

As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) are processed, this processing takes place exclusively on basis of a legal permission or with your express consent. Your data will not be disclosed to third parties without your explicit consent.

Please note, however, that data transmission over the internet (for example, when communicating via e-mail) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data from access by third parties is therefore not possible. You should also be aware that by publicly sharing images, comments, or similar material on our sites, unknown third parties may copy and distribute this information on other sites. As a result, shared information can still be found on the internet after it has been deleted from our site.

### Newsletter

You can register for our newsletter via our website. The data you enter will be used to send newsletters and registration information. Anonymous user statistics are also created using this data. Your data will also not be disclosed to third parties. The processing of your information is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.

If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need a valid e-mail address from you, as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that you agree to receive the newsletter. To ensure that an e-mail address is not abused by third parties in our mailing list, we work in accordance with the law with the so-called "double-opt-in" procedure. As part of this process, the order date of the newsletter, the dispatch of the confirmation email and the receipt of the confirmation of registration will be logged.

Optionally, you can provide information about your name, your home town, your professional status and your personal IT skills. This information is used to personalize your newsletter and to create anonymous user statistics.

The newsletter is distributed via "MailChimp", a newsletter shipping platform of Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave # 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.

The e-mail addresses of our Newsletter recipients, as well as their other information described in these notes, are stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletters on our behalf. Furthermore, MailChimp may, according to its own information, use this data to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the shipping and the presentation of the newsletter or for economic purposes, to determine from which countries the recipients come. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write them down or to pass them on to third parties.

We rely on the reliability, IT and data security of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified under the US-EU privacy shield "Privacy Shield" and is committed to complying with EU data protection requirements. Furthermore, we have concluded a data processing agreement with MailChimp. This is a contract in which MailChimp pledges to protect the data of our users, to process it in accordance with its privacy policy on our behalf and, in particular, not to disclose it to third parties. The privacy policy of MailChimp can be viewed here.

The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the MailChimp server when the newsletter is opened. This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval. This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.

Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our desire nor that of MailChimp to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.

There are cases in which we direct the newsletter recipients to the MailChimp websites. For example, Our newsletters contain a link that allows newsletter recipients to retrieve newsletters online (for example, in the case of display problems in the e-mail program). Furthermore, newsletter recipients can store their data, such as correct the e-mail address later. Similarly, the privacy policy of MailChimp is only available on their page.

In this context, we pointed out that on the websites of MailChimp cookies are used and thus personal data processed by MailChimp, their partners and service providers used (such as Google Analytics). We have no influence on this data collection. For more information, see the privacy policy of MailChimp.

The granted consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter or by contacting our data protection officer.

### Integration of services and content of third parties

Our offer may include content, services and services of other providers. These are, for example, maps provided by Google Maps, videos from YouTube as well as graphics and images from other websites. In order for these data to be accessed and displayed in the user's browser, the transmission of the IP address is absolutely necessary. The corresponding providers (hereinafter referred to as "third party providers") thus perceive the IP address of the respective user.

We have no control over whether the third-party IP address may be stored. This process is used in the case, inter alia, statistical purposes. If we are aware that the IP address is being stored, we will inform our users.

### Facebook social plug-in

We include social networking plug-ins on our websites (Address: 1601 South California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA). You will recognize the plug-ins - an overview can be found here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/Plug-ins/ - on Like-Button (Like) or the Facebook logo.

If you call one of our websites with Facebook plug-in, a direct connection to Facebook will be established. We have no control over the type and extent of data collected, stored and processed by Facebook. We can only inform you according to our knowledge.

Facebook will be informed via the plug-in that you have accessed the corresponding website of our offer. This also applies to users who are not registered with Facebook. In this case, there is the possibility that Facebook stores the IP address.

If you are a member of Facebook and logged in, the call of a website with Facebook plug-in can be clearly assigned to your user account on Facebook. In addition, the plug-ins transmit all interactions, for example, if you use the Like button or leave a comment.

To prevent Facebook from storing information about you, please log out of Facebook before visiting our websites. You can also block the plug-ins with add-ons for the browser (for example, "Facebook Blocker").

For privacy policy information, the purpose and scope of data collection and processing, and privacy settings on Facebook, please visit: http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php.

### Twitter Social Plugin

This offer uses features of the Twitter service. This is provided by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. Twitter offers the so-called "Tweet" and "Follow" functions. If you use the features of Twitter on our websites, the websites you visit will be linked to your Twitter account and may be shared with other users. This data is also transmitted to Twitter.

We are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and its use by Twitter as a provider. For more information, please refer to the Twitter Privacy Policy at http://twitter.com/privacy.Twitter provides the option to set your privacy preferences yourself at the following link: http://twitter.com/account/settings.

### Duration of data storage

Personal data is stored according to the principles of data avoidance and data economy only as long as required or required by law (legal storage period). If the purpose of the information collected is omitted or the storage period ends, we block or delete the data.

### Right to information, correction, suspension, cancellation and opposition

You can ask for information about the data we have stored about you at any time. You may request a correction, blocking or deletion of your data. The data can only be deleted if the storage of the data is not required by law (eg in the context of data retention) or if the data is subject to an archiving obligation. Instead, we can block your data.

You may revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data in writing at any time without stating reasons. In this case, we will remove your data as soon as possible from our website.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact our Privacy Officer.

### Change of our privacy policy

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy in order to keep it up-to-date and to comply with legal requirements. The latest version of the Privacy Policy applies whenever you visit our sites.
