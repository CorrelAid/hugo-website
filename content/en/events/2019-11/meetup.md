# Let's meetup - 2019 edition!

Thanks to all the speakers, participants and organisers of this years CorrelAid Meetup, it was a blast!

[Here](https://correlaid.github.io/workshops/germany-meetups.html#november-2019-berlin) you can find all the slides and information of the talks.

## What?

Like every year, there'll be an exciting mix of workshops about all things data science, data for good, useful tools and other things - for beginners and advanced folks alike. New this year: We have a focus topic: Open Data. We'll talk with cool organizations from the Open Data sphere and figure out how we as data-for-gooders can help society using Open Data.
Finally, depending on where you're from, you'll get the opportunity to connect with other like-minded people from your area and join your local CorrelAidX chapter (or start a new one)?

Never been to a CorrelAid meetup? Perfect! It's the best place to get to know CorrelAid. We're looking forward to meeting you!
You can read more about a "newbie"'s meetup experience in this [blog post](https://correlaid.org/blog/meetup-mannheim/) written by Florian about his experience last year (German only).

## When?

Friday, 29th of November (starting 4pm but no problem if you arrive later), to Sunday, 1st of December (ca. 3pm).

## Where?

We're very happy to be hosted by the [CityLAB Berlin](https://www.citylab-berlin.org/). Thanks to the CityLab crew!
