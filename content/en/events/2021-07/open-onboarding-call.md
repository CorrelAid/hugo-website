Join our Open Onboarding Call to learn more about the structure and workings of CorrelAid and where you can get involved.

## This Event

At our monthly Open Onboarding Call, we provide a vivid insight into the diverse work of CorrelAid. Here, you will not only get to know how our general cooperation looks like, but also how our project work works and how our local groups are organized.

There will also be time and space for all your questions.

Check out [this pad](https://pad.correlaid.org/J5r2SI3kRvi9SSDdd2hccQ) for the tentative agenda and the minutes of previous onboarding calls.
