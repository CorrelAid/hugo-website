## The event 

For our third Open Online Data Meetup (OODM)*, it's getting shiny! Cosima Meyer will share her experience using R and Shiny for science communication to make the results of her research accessible to a wider audience. The talk will be followed by a Q&A and a short discussion moderated by our host Nina from the CorrelAid core team.


We are looking forward to see you at the talk!

## The talk

Research produces fascinating findings. But it is often difficult to present them to a broader audience beyond the research paper. Shiny apps offer researchers (both in academia and business) sophisticated tools to generate web applications that make the results accessible, understandable, and interactive. The talk will guide you through the necessary steps to set up your own ShinyApp and discuss lessons learned from building a ShinyApp using Shiny for R, shinydashboards, and echarts4r.
