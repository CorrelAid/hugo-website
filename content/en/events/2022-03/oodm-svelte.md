## The event
Marco and Stefan will give an introduction to svelte, a Javascript web framework which makes it quite easy to create web apps. 
This are their plans for the evening: "We will go a bit into details what svelte actually is, how we can use it in an analytical approach and to show data. To make it more tractable for us, we will set everything that makes sense in relation to R Shiny and look where common points are and svelte will accelerate this work by a magnitude. We will close with a little Hello World hands on exercise."


## The Speakers
Marco and Stefan are both theoretical ecologist turned to the dark side by the economy and now earn their living developing web applications covering a wide range of topics. From genetic data, to global crisis events and financial timeseries data - they bring it to the web.
