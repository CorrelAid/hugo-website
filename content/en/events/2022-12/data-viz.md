When you are trying to visualize your data, you are often spoilt for choice - should I go for a bar chart? Or maybe a pie chart? Will the heatmap potentially make my points even clearer?
Choosing the right chart is very important to get your points across to your audience.
This **Data Visualization with R workshop** will teach you how to narrow down the many options at hand and give an introduction on how you create the charts you need in the programming language R.
