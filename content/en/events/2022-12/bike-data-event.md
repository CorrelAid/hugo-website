## The event

The mobility transition is an important puzzle piece in combating climate change and making our cities and communities greener and healthier. As we work towards a more sustainable mobility, more people are encouraged to switch to more sustainable modes of transport such as biking.
In this social and political process, data can play an important role, from supporting decision making and planning to shining a light on pressing problems. In this project showcase, we present Data4Good initiatives from the CorrelAid community that aim to support the transition towards biking.

## Talks & Speakers

The event will feature four talks followed by a Q&A and space for discussion.
