This Tuesday Sascha Kuhn will talk about his ongoing research, data collection and analysis of energy consumption patterns in Kosovo.

Kosovo currently ranks among the five most inefficient countries in terms of energy consumption in Europe. Lower income families spend up to 20% of their annual income on electricity. Although the national tariff setting is flexible and allows cheaper electricity usage at night, households so far are not sufficiently aware of the environmental and economic benefits this entail. Behavioural approaches may help to change energy-related behaviours such as to promote energy conservation and peak-shaving. The presentation will be about a behavioural field experiment (RCT) that tests ways to change consumption patterns. We will look at the results of a household survey and electricity consumption data of 3.000 households.

Sascha Kuhn is a PhD candidate in social psychology at the University Heidelberg. For his work at the German Development Institute in Bonn he applies behavioural theories in field experiments to motivate consumers around the globe to act sustainably.
