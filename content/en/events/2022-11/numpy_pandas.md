You have already had first contact with Python, but want more? 
You want to get to know two of the most important and strongest modules for Python?
Then this is the right workshop for you. Based on two small projects, one about the series Stromberg and one about Pokemon, we will explore the basics of the Numpy and Pandas modules. 
By the end of the workshop you will have mastered the basics in Numpy and Pandas, understand the logic behind them, and be able to use them for your own projects. 
(We will also find out a bit about Stromberg and Pokemon).
