Have you ever wondered how you could use Python to analyze your data? Then our workshop "Data Analysis with Python - Numpy & Pandas", the second CorrelAid Konstanz workshop from our Python series, is the right place for you!

While Numpy is an import module for scientific computing, you can create and modify tables with Pandas. Together, these two modules offer all sorts of ways to generate data, modify it, and perform calculations based on it.

In our course we want to show you how you can use these functions for yourself. On 09.11. we will meet from 17:45 to 20:15 at the University of Konstanz. In our course we will proceed step by step and give you a practical insight with the help of exercises. To participate, you should know the basics of Python and have worked with import modules/packages in Python or another programming language before.
