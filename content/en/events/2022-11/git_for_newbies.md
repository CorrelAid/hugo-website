When it comes to working with code, whatever programming language it is you work with, you have probably heard of **Git and Github** - but do you know what they are, exactly, and how they work? If not, the **Git & Github for Newbies workshop** is just right for you!
You will learn what the version control tools Git and Github are, what makes them so powerful and widely used and with a few hands-on tasks, you will also be able to use them yourself to manage your coding projects even better in the future!
