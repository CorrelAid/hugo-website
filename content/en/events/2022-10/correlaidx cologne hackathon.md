Cycling in Cologne often resembles an adventure: bike lanes suddenly stop, are blocked or missing in important places. Especially cyclists are often seen as weak road users (after pedestrians) and are often closely overtaken by cars and trucks, although a minimum distance of 1.50m is prescribed for overtaking in built-up areas.
In the Cologne/Bonn region, we have so far measured over 4000 overtaking events with a few self-built OpenBike sensors, and we also have a large data set from Constance. In a joint hackathon with you, we would now like to find out which small and large "aha moments" are contained in this data. On Saturday, October 22, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., we will meet live and also virtually to answer a self-selected question in small groups and to develop further ideas together. On site, you will also have the opportunity to collect data yourself with an OpenBikeSensor and borrow it for a limited period of time. We are looking forward to seeing you!
