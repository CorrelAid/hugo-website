Join the 5th Open Online Data Meetup (OODM) 

## The Workshop
Are you sometimes puzzled why matplotlib has to be so complicated?
This talk and tutorial tries give you an overall idea of how to use matplotlib
and its ecosystem (e.g. seaborn or pandas), to help you quickly apply solutions
you find on stackoverflow or elsewhere. It's conceived as an introduction to
key concepts and functionalities in matplotlib for scientific plotting, but
should hopefully be also interesting to a wider audience looking for an
introductory talk. The tutorial runs on [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and allows you to practise along if you want.
It won't give you what to plot, but hopefully the understanding of how to plot.
Basic familiarity with python, numpy and pandas is assumed.

We are looking forward to see you at the event! :)
