Join the workshops of CorrelAid's first project cycle. 

## This Event

During the month of May we are holding workshops on: Data Management (6 May 2021), Survey Design (13 May 2021), Data from the Web (18 May 2021) and Creating a Database (25 May 2021). Most workshops will be recorded, but can be viewed collaboratively during our Watchparties. Each workshop will be followed by a live Q&A session the following week. All workshops and Q&A sessions will be in German.
