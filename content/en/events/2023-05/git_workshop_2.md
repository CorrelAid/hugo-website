## Workshop
Git is at the foundation of all our coding projects at CorrelAid. As a popular version control system, Git allows you to keep track of different versions of your code and configuration files and to efficiently collaborate with others on joined projects. 
Join us for our first Git training session hosted for the CorrelAid community by d-fine. We will start with a joint kick-off on May 2nd, where you will get to know our trainers and will be introduced to the topic and the training format. The training incorporates hands-on exercises and self-study resources that you can also complete at your own pace. But you will not be left alone. We shall offer three additional online sessions on May 3rd, 9th, and 11th at 6-7 pm that you can use to get feedback and ask questions.

The topics covered by the training material and hands-on exercises are:

-	Installing Git on your machine and understanding its different components.
-	Basics of bash, including shell commands and shell variables.
-	Git basics: Understand the two objects repository and commit, learn the basic Git commands to initialize a new Git repository, add and commit files and changes, and retrieve older versions of files.
-	Git advanced: Build a mental model of how Git branching works and practice the basics of how to work with and merge branches, including how to resolve conflicts.
-	Git expert: Learn about the most widely used workflows for collaboration with Git in a consistent manner and master advanced topics such as modifying Git history. This should enable you to contribute code in most projects.

## Language
Provided training materials are in English, interaction with trainers is also possible in German.
