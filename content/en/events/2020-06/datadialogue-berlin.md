[CorrelAidX Berlin](correlaid-x/berlin) are planning to remotely host their first data dialogue of the year on Thursday, June 11th at 7pm. These events help non-profits use data science to support their organisational goals by facilitating an open discussion between NPO representatives and the CorrelAid community.

This time, our guests will come from the [Amadeu Antonio Stiftung](https://www.amadeu-antonio-stiftung.de/) and [GoVolunteer](https://govolunteer.com/de), two amazing organisations that do important work.
Data dialogue events are an excellent way to get involved for those new to CorrelAid and you do not need expertise in any particular topic or much experience as a data scientist. As this event will be held remotely, you can also attend if you're based outside Berlin.

We're looking for up to 20 volunteers who will be split into separate discussion groups (5 per group). We're also looking for people who are interested in being dedicated moderators inside the discussion groups. We will provide guidance for the moderators before the event, so no moderating experience is necessary.

## Registration
If you're be interested in taking part in the data dialogue as either a discussion group member or moderator please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScrsL5yaCkA2nEK_GuCPji5iJb8HGpbOd0LWojkltGJ5_bkSA/viewform)!
