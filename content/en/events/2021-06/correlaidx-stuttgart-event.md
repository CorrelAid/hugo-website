## This Event

CorrelAidX Stuttgart invites data scientists and those interested in the use of data to its latest talk: „Data Science, Meaning, and Diversity - Epistemic Humility and Standpoint Theory for doing data science better". The CorrelAidX local chapter Stuttgart hosts the online talk by Ismael Kherroubi Garcia, Ethics Research Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute, UK.

In this talk, he will argue that acknowledging the source and representational value of data in data science is important if we are seeking actionable knowledge. By "actionable knowledge", he means knowledge that can be drawn on by other researchers and policymakers to continue advancing how society interacts with the world and understands itself. This implies the need for epistemic humility and diversity — as it is proposed by standpoint theory — for data to be conducive to practical (scientific) knowledge.

Ismael is Ethics Research Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute, which is the national institute for data science and artificial intelligence in the United Kingdome. Prior to this, he worked for several years in Human Resources and across diverse industries, from fintech to the performing arts. In 2019, Ismael took on an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).
