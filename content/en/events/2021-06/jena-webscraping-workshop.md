I donâ€™t need to know everything, I just need to know where to find it, when I need it. - Albert Einstein

Cat pictures, news, weather data, social networks, and tons of shopping opportunities aren't all the internet has to offer these days.
It is also the largest digital collection of knowledge in human history to date.
Various search engines help to find and access the data you are looking for within a few seconds. As the size and distribution of the data grows, it is often no longer enough to know where to find them, but to be able to extract them from the Internet in a suitable form in order to gain new insights and knowledge from them.

In this workshop Jan Dix (one of the founding members of CorrelAid) gives a short,
simple introduction to web scraping -
a technology for automatic, structured downloading of data from the Internet.

The workshop is aimed at anyone interested in data with basic programming experience in Python. After a short explanation of the structure of websites and HTML, small practical examples and code snippets explain how the desired data can be extracted from the Internet.
