## How much do the projects cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables Data4Good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. However, in most cases, you need to cover travel and accomodation costs for the project team members for the kickoff workshop. You also need to provide the location for this workshop. Those expenses usually amount to 500-1000 Euro.
