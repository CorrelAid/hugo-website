# Join CorrelAid e.V.

## Why join CorrelAid e.V.?

CorrelAid is a **network** of data science enthusiasts who want to change the world with the help of data science. CorrelAid **e.V.** is a registered German non-profit association and the **legal structure** that supports the work of CorrelAid. Our employees Nina, Phil and Frie who make a significant part of the CorrelAid offers possible are employed by the association. CorrelAid e.V. consists of about 50 members, amongst whom the board and the ethics committee are elected.


**Important: All CorrelAid offers and activities are open to everyone, regardless of whether they are a member of the association CorrelAid e.V.** (exception: activity in the bodies of the association, currently board and ethics committee).

_Why should you become a member anyway?_ 

1. support CorrelAids idea!

As a member of CorrelAid e.V. you support our work ideally as well as financially (if you can). 
As a non-profit organization, we provide almost all of our services free of charge, from workshops to Data4Good projects to our mentoring program. Hence, membership fees are especially helpful to us as they are a recurring and independent source of funding. 
With your contributions, we can co-finance fundamental CorrelAid building blocks such as servers or software licenses. This digital infrastructure is the basis of CorrelAid as a "digital association". In addition, we organize a big community event every year which is also funded by the association. 

2. Make decisions and take responsibility!

As an _active member_ of the association you are expected to take part in the annual general assembly. The general assembly decides on motions that have a significant impact on the structure of CorrelAid. As a member you can bring in your own motions. In addition, the assembly elects the Board and the Ethics Committee - bodies that have significant influence on the work of CorrelAid. At the same time, an active membership allows you to run for these important bodies yourself!
