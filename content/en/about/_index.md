# Our work

In 2015, CorrelAid has officially been registered as a non-profit association in Konstanz, Germany. As of today, our network consists of around {{< param num_members >}} volunteers, all of which contribute their very own skills and ideas. Apart from that, a core team of around 15 people takes care of general organisational matters. So far, we have successfully launched over 35 projects, always in close cooperation with non-profit organisations of different size and scope (e.g. Ashoka, The European Youth Parliament or streetfootballworld), and organised more than 50 Data Science related workshops.
We work in three areas: data volunteering, education, and dialogue.

## Data Volunteering

In our volunteering projects, we connect non-profit organisations with a team of volunteer data analysts from our network. Together, we will support NPOs in optimising their processes, discovering new insights and working towards a more efficient allocation of resources. In general, projects run from 2 to 4 months. 

When setting up the teams, diversity plays an important role. This allows us to gather all relevant skills required for a project, while at the same time providing a unique and valuable learning opportunity for all people involved in the project.

## Education and Workshops

Workshops are the key to maintaining and improving the skill set of our data science network. CorrelAid unites analysts and data experts from a variety of different academic and professional backgrounds. This diversity allows us to constantly learn from one another and forms the basis of the "peer learning" approach that is implemented in our workshops.

    What I enjoyed most, was publishing a new version of our dashboard. Usually, this happened on Sunday evenings, 
    after a weekend of programming and implementing new ideas. I've learned a lot from my teammates and our partners 
    at GoVolunteer during the project: Not only did I improve my coding skills in R, but I also learned how to do 
    effective project work in a vivid virtual team.

    I attended the data journalism workshop at the Meetup in Mannheim. After the workshop I overcame the awe to start my
    own project and download and experiment with public data sources.

## Dialogue

We have the vision of establishing an open dialogue between the civic society and the data science community: Such a dialogue could be used to develop new ideas on how to use data science for social good. This is why we came up with the concept of the "Data Dialogue". During such an event, three to five non-profit organisations will have the opportunity to meet, discuss and connect with around 20 data scientists. By doing so, both sides can obtain a more in-depth impression of each other and gauge which relevant data is already present at the NPO and how it can be used to support the organisation's goals.
