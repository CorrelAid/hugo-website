# About CorrelAid 
## Our Mission

CorrelAid is a non-partisan non-profit network of data science enthusiasts who want to change the world through data science. We dedicate our work to the social sector and those organizations that strive for making the world a better place. In order to improve data literacy in society, we share our knowledge within our network and beyond and are always looking for ways to broaden our horizons. 

We value open knowledge management and transparency in our work wherever possible while complying with GDPR regulations and following strong principles of data ethics.


## Our Work

Our work is based on three pillars:


- We enable data analysts and scientists to apply their knowledge for the common good and social organizations to increase their impact on society by conducting pro-bono data for good **(Data4Good) projects** focusing on data analysis


- We **educate** social organizations on data-related topics and foster the individual development journey of our community members by offering them opportunities to connect, share and learn 


- We broaden our outreach by engaging in a **dialogue** about the value and usefulness of data and data analysis for the common good


## Our values 

We are an inclusive network in which diversity is valued and promoted. We firmly reject any form of discrimination, violence or harassment. We value appreciative communication and value each otherâ€™s voluntarily dedicated time and work. The learning experience of our volunteers is the core of our mission. In addition, their involvement in our skilled-volunteering projects benefits the social sector and broader society. In our work, we adhere to the [code of conduct](/en/about/codeofconduct) we set for our work.
