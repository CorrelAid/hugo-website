# Ethics commission

The ethics commission is a working group of the association CorrelAid e.V. It reviews the association's activities with regard to general ethical values and becomes active upon request. The ethics commission will then examine the request and issue a written statement on its ethical aspects, stating whether / under which circumstances it is in line with CorrelAid's ethical standards. 

An unoffical English translation of the rules of procedures of the ethics commission can be viewed [here](/material/correlaid_ev/2021-12-17_ethikkommission_rules_of_procedure_en.pdf). The German original can be found [here](/material/correlaid_ev/2021-12-17_ethikkommission_geschaeftsordnung.pdf).


## Main Tasks

#### Evaluation of Data4Good projects
If you are in contact with an organization and feel unsure about whether the project you're scoping would be a suitable CorrelAid Data4Good project, contact the ethics committee at [ethics@correlaid.org](mailto:ethics@correlaid.org).

More information about processes and tools coming soon. 

#### Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics
The ethics commission maintains the [Code of Conduct](/en/about/codeofconduct) (currently under revision) and the Code of Ethics (see below, currently work in progress).

It is also the  point of contact to report violations of the Code of Conduct:
If you come across a situation that appears to violate the CorrelAid [Code of Conduct](/en/about/codeofconduct), if you want to raise a concern about a possible breach of the Code of Conduct, or if you experienced or witnessed a behavior that does not align  with our working principles, the ethics committee is here to support you.

You can reach the ethics committee by contacting [ethics@correlaid.org](mailto:ethics@correlaid.org).

# Code of ethics

**This content is currently in revision by the ethics committee**

CorrelAid is an independent and inclusive non-partisan network. Our projects are aimed at supporting non-profit organisations in expanding their impact by enabling them to actively participate in the digital world.

We try to keep entry barriers as low as possible and provide the volunteers in our network with diverse opportunities of getting involved - Allowing them to find one that fits their lives.

When deciding on partners to cooperate with, our ethics commission will place great emphasis on the organisation's dedication to [our values]({{< ref "/about#our-values" >}}), its commitment to social good and the benefit for society resulting from a potential project.
