Each year [IOMIDS](https://iomids.com/) enables our volunteers to join their data science courses for free. Their course range includes introductionary classes to workshops on deep learning. In class, participants do not only learn the theory related to analytical tools but they can practice their skills in projects with real-world data. The stipends are allocated during an application process announced via our [community newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff).
