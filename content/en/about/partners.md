Each year [IOMIDS](https://iomids.com/) enables our volunteers to join their data science courses for free. Their course range includes introductionary classes to workshops on deep learning. In class, participants do not only learn the theory related to analytical tools but they can practice their skills in projects with real-world data. The stipends are allocated during an application process announced via our [community newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff).

Together with [D3 - so geht digital](https://so-geht-digital.de), [OpenTransfer](https://opentransfer.de/) and [GoVolunteer](https://govolunteer.com) we came up with *"Pl√∂tzlich digital: Die Sprechstunde* ("digital over night: the walk-in hour") at the beginning of the Corona crisis. Every other week, nonprofits get the opportunity to learn more about new tools for digital collaboration. Whether Slack, Trello, HumHub, Office365, Nextcloud or Password Manager: experts give a 45-minute practical introduction into a tool that they know by heart. Thanks to the excellent organizational skills of the D3 team, the format has been going strong for 1,5 years! You can find more information - and the recordings of all past sessions - [here](https://so-geht-digital.de/ploetzlich-digital-die-sprechstunde/).
