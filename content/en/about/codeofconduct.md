# Code of Conduct


*The goal of this document is to give you actionable advice and guide interventions for Code of Conduct breaches.*
_If you want to contribute to the Code of Conduct, you can leave comments in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13pzXFAYiH_rVnN1draAAcEi75EHspb7vZBhldCuMTl8/edit?usp=sharing)._



## How we work

We enable data analysts and scientists to expand their knowledge and apply it to topics of societal relevance. Therefore, we provide educational opportunities for our community as well as for NPOs by conducting a range of Data4Good projects. Our projects are aimed at supporting institutions in enhancing their social impact by enabling them to make active use of their own and publicly available data. At the same time, we are building a community of civic-minded data professionals and enthusiasts to exchange knowledge and connect.

The work that this community does in cooperation with our partners is at the heart of CorrelAid. We always pursue this work in alignment with our values. We also pursue these values in our public representation, and in our collaboration and communication with partners and other community members. 

These are the principles we agree on for our community:

**Oppose problematic behavior**

To make sure that our community can be a safer environment, we all need to adhere to our values and oppose problematic or discriminating behavior whenever it occurs. Each and everyone is asked to take part in creating this safer space.

**Be respectful**

Approach people with respect within the community, during your work for CorrelAid and beyond.

Not showing respect can include but is not limited to: 



* invasion of personal space, if not explicitly stated and agreed upon
* bullying & exclusionary behavior
* discriminatory language
* deadnaming & misgendering
* not respecting expressed needs, desires and boundaries of others
* violent communication 
* lack of adequate notice on the plans to stop communication and / or collaboration to fellow volunteers
* jokes about marginalized communities 
* taking up major shares of talking time, constant interrupting 
* focusing on overgeneralized statements instead of “I-messages”

When facing such behavior, we strive to reflect upon the offending person’s situation and characteristics, as well as potential biases that we might have towards them based on discriminatory structures.

**Strive towards a more inclusive environment**

Keep yourself informed about diversity and inclusion issues that affect CorrelAid. You have the responsibility to contribute your share. If you observe behavior that affects this inclusive environment, speak up.

**Dealing with errors constructively**

Own up to your mistakes and be respectful towards others when they own up to theirs. Become active to solve problems with the help of the community. The community is there to help, it’s your responsibility to ask for help.

**Communicate transparently**

If possible, communicate transparently, e.g., by using a public channel instead of private messages. This makes it easier for others to learn and participate in conversations they find interesting. Be eager to explain your methods and what you are doing in clear and simple terms and aim to demystify data science. 

**Favor practical and sustainable solutions over more complex systems**

To make sure that your solutions are understandable, maintainable, sustainable and useful, try to keep them as simple as possible. Strive for the simplest solution, not for the most impressive one. 

**Self-Determination**

The Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct are your guidelines. In the end, it is you who takes the decisions for yourself within CorrelAid. Take them responsibly. 

Sometimes you might not be sure how to handle a situation or question. This is normal and nothing to be ashamed of. This is actually what the community and core team are there for: You can ask for help!

**Handle personal data with care**

Keep yourself informed about current data privacy policies. If you are not sure how to handle projects or issues that might involve dealing with personal or otherwise sensitive data, the community and ethics committee are here to help. It’s your responsibility to seek out that help.

**Consider Open Source and different technologies**

Consider open source, partner wants and needs, and your own preferences when choosing technology.To further enrich the community's knowledge, always consider sharing what you learned, no matter which technology you end up using.


## Violations of the Code of Conduct

**Reporting violations of the Code of Conduct**

If you come across a situation that appears to violate the CorrelAid’s Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct, if you want to raise a concern about a possible breach of the code of ethics, or if you experienced or witnessed a behavior that does not align with our working principles, the CorrelAid Ethics committee is there to support you. 

Guidelines for action after Code of Conduct breaches are currently being drafted. For the time being, consequences can nonetheless be taken depending on the severity of the breach. Responsibility for the determination of these consequences lies with the Ethics committee and/or the organizing party of events.
