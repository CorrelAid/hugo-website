# FAQ
## How much do the projects cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables Data4Good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. Coordination work before, during and after the project is typically done by Frie, one of our three full-time employees. Frie's position is funded by money acquired through grants or [donations](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/58963-correlaid-e-v-foerderung-von-datenwissenschaft-in-der-zivilgesellschaft).
