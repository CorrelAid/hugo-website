# Requirements and general timeline

CorrelAid is happy to support all individuals and non-profit organizations that work in line with our [values](/en/about/#our-values). Nevertheless, we might sometimes decide not to take up  certain projects, e.g. if they have no clear educational value for our volunteers or if there are ethical concerns. In such cases, our Ethics Board decides whether the project will be carried out or not.


Since the beginning of 2021, we have organized our projects in the **Project Cycle** framework. This means that projects almost\* always start with each quarter, i.e. at the beginning of January, April, July or October. The duration of the projects may well be less or more than three months, though. 

Since our internal processes in the run-up to the start of the project cycle - sending out the call for applications, collecting applications, selecting the teams and onboarding - take about four weeks, you should contact us with your idea at least 1.5 months before the start of the project cycle.

# FAQ
## How much do the projects cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables Data4Good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. Coordination work before, during and after the project is typically done by Frie, one of our three full-time employees. Frie's position is funded by money acquired through grants or [donations](https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/58963-correlaid-e-v-foerderung-von-datenwissenschaft-in-der-zivilgesellschaft).
