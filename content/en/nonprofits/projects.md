# Our Data4Good Projects for NPOs

In our skilled volunteering projects, we connect data scientist volunteers from our network network of over {{< param num_members >}} volunteers with nonprofit organisations. Through those projects, our volunteers have the opportunity to apply their existing skills and gain new knowledge. At the same time, they support nonprofit organisations with solving their data-related challenges. 

Over 2-6 months and in teams from 2-7 data scientists, our volunteers have tackled diverse data challenges of nonprofits: from data collection, data visualization and exploratory data analysis to automation, reporting and advanced statistical analyses using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
