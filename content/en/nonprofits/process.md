## The process
A usual CorrelAid process might look like this:


{{< process 
    
>}}
first contact: either CorrelAid contacts you or you contact us and we establish some form of communication, usually via email.
{{< /process >}}


2. problem definition & definition of project scope: together, our project coordination team and you work out what exactly the challenge is that you are facing and whether it can be solved using data science techniques. If this is the case, we scope the project, i.e. we roughly define what will be done as part of the project. This phase usually takes 1-4 weeks, depending on the problem.
3. call for applications & team selection and onboarding
4. kickoff 
5. project work
6. handover 
7. follow-up
