While an understanding of digital technologies has developed in the business world over recent years, civil society and nonprofit organizations have been mostly left behind so far. This became clear in the [Digital Report 2020](https://www.digital-report.org/): 72% of the 3,400 surveyed organizations have an organizational strategy, but only 38% collect and/or use (external) data for strategy development. Only 30% of organizations have an theory of change, and only 28% actually measure their social impact. There is a lack of financial resources and employees with the skillsets necessary to successfully leverage the new opportunities granted by data and data analytics. Finally, the majority of employees in the social sector rate their skills and knowledge in handling data as too low. 

Yet, data and its analysis can be an important enabler of social impact by helping to answer the following questions:

- What constitutes the challenge that we want to tackle in society?
- How can we make better decisions?
- How can we be more efficient and effective?

Through our work, we help people and organizations committed to making the world a better place with exploring these potentials.
