# For Non-Profits 

## CorrelAid Data4Good projects
In our skilled volunteering projects, we connect data scientist volunteers from our network network of over 1300 volunteers with nonprofit organisations. Through those projects, our volunteers have the opportunity to apply their existing skills and gain new knowledge. At the same time, they support nonprofit organisations with solving their data-related challenges. 
Over 2-6 months and in teams from 2-7 data scientists, our volunteers have tackled diverse data challenges of nonprofits: from data collection, data visualization and exploratory data analysis to automation, reporting and advanced statistical analyses using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## The project process
How does a CorrelAid project work? What are the phases and what work do you as a nonprofit need to do?




{{< process 
    title="Project definition"
    duration="1-3 weeks"
    work="**Your input**: iterative exchange with project coordination team (in total ~1-3 hours)"
    icon="fa-comments"
>}}
Together with our project coordinators, you work on defining the challenge that you face. We then decide whether our volunteers can help us. If this is the case, we define the approximate scope and duration of the project and collect the content for the call for applications.
{{< /process >}}


{{< process 
    title="Call for Applications and Team Selection"
    duration="1-3 weeks"
    work="**Your input**: none"
    icon="fa-search"
>}}
We send out the call for applications to our network and select a project team of 2-8 voluntary data analysts.
{{< /process >}}

{{< process 
    title="Onboarding and Kickoff"
    duration="1-3 weeks"
    work="**Your input**:  find a meeting slot for the kickoff, create content and programme for the kickoff together with project coordinators"
    icon="fa-rocket"
>}}
We onboard the team to all the tooling that we use for communication and collaboration. At the same time, our project coordiantors, the project lead and you plan the kickoff workshop where you and the team can meet, get to know each other and more clearly define goals, modes of collaboration and content of the project. 
If possible, this workshop takes place at your office or in the city you're mainly operating over the course of a weekend. If this is not possible, the kickoff is a remote online event (~2-3 hours). 
{{< /process >}}

{{< process 
    title="Projekt work"
    duration="1-6 months"
    work="**Your input**: meet regularly with the project team (at least every 2 weeks), give feedback, answer questions of the project team in a responsive way"
    icon="fa-laptop-code"
>}}
The project team works on a solution for your data challenge while maintaining close and iterative exchange cycles with you. In this way, feedback cycles are kept short which in turn is important for the success of the project. 
{{< /process >}}


{{< process 
    title="Handover"
    duration="1 day - 2 weeks"
    work="**Your input**: Participation in a handover workshop (~several hours), make sure to meet technical requirements for taking over outputs that need to be hosted (if needed), work on understanding the results and outputs, their maintenance and usage."
    icon="fa-sync-alt"
>}}
In a workshop, the team hands over the results and outputs and explains to you how you can use and maintain them if applicable. If you need to host the output yourself (e.g. a dashboard), our volunteers work together with your IT experts to ensure that it can be successfully used in your organisation. 
{{< /process >}}

{{< process 
    title="Follow-Up"
    duration="1-3 days"
    work="**Your input**: Fill out a feedback survey (~15 minutes), give input for the representation of your project on the CorrelAid website (~1-2 hours)"
    icon="fa-question"

>}}
Both the project team and you will be surveyed about your experience with the project. 
In addition, you support the project team with creating content for a project description which will be displayed on the CorrelAid website after the project has ended.
{{< /process >}}


{{< process 
    title="problem definition & definition of project scope"
    duration="1-3 weeks"
>}}
problem definition & definition of project scope: together, our project coordination team and you work out what exactly the challenge is that you are facing and whether it can be solved using data science techniques. If this is the case, we scope the project, i.e. we roughly define what will be done as part of the project. This phase usually takes 1-4 weeks, depending on the problem.
{{< /process >}}


{{< process 
    title="Project work"
    duration="1-6 months"
>}}
The CorrelAid team works on your data challenge. Regular calls between you and the team ensure that feedback cycles are short.

## FAQ
### How much does it cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables Data4Good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. However, in most cases, you need to cover travel and accomodation costs for the project team members for the kickoff workshop. You also need to provide the location for this workshop. Those expenses usually amount to 500-1000 Euro.
