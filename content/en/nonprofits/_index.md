# For Non-Profits 




## CorrelAid data4good projects
CorrelAid works together with non-profit organisations to support them with their data-related challenges. We achieve this by connecting non-profits with data scientists from our network of over 1300 data scientist volunteers. At the same time, our projects serve as opportunities for our volunteers to apply their existing skills and gain new knowledge. 
Over 2-6 months and in teams from 2-7 data scientists, our volunteers have tackled diverse data challenges: from data collection, data visualization and exploratory data analysis to automation, reporting and advanced statistical analyses using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

{{< process 
    title="problem definition & definition of project scope"
    duration="1-3 weeks"

problem definition & definition of project scope: together, our project coordination team and you work out what exactly the challenge is that you are facing and whether it can be solved using data science techniques. If this is the case, we scope the project, i.e. we roughly define what will be done as part of the project. This phase usually takes 1-4 weeks, depending on the problem.

## FAQ
### How much does it cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables data4good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. However, in most cases, you need to cover travel and accomodation costs for our project team members for the kickoff workshop. You also need to provide the location for this workshop. Those expenses usually amount to 500-1000 Euro.
