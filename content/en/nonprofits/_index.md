# For Non-Profits 

## You think your organization does not work with data? Well, think again…

The organizations which we have previously collaborated with come from various backgrounds: social work with children or the elderly, political rights activists and advocates for migrant communites or disabled people but also sport clubs and associations for recreational activities. At first glance, you might think that these organizations do not work with data in their eveyday business and therefore cannot really profit from collaborating with CorrelAid. This perspective relates to the problem that many people cannot really imagine what data basically is and how data scientists work with it.

Thinking about data, may people think about long Excel tables and boring afternoons in the office. However, by definition data refers to information. If a sufficiently large amount of information is collected, data scientists can observe, analyse and predict patterns and trends.
EXAMPLE PLEASE

If your organization works with digital formats of the information necessary to keep the daily operations running, it is highly likely that it works with data.

    data of donations
    social media data (Twitter, Facebook,…)
    protocols/minutes
    member database
    application documents
    experience reports
    survey data
    newsletter data
    website data

## What is a CorrelAid project? 
CorrelAid works together with non-profits to support them with their data-related challenges. At the same time, our projects serve as opportunities for our data scientists to apply their existing skills and expand them. 

## What is the process? 
A usual CorrelAid process might look like this:

1. first contact: either CorrelAid contacts you or you contact us and we establish some form of communication, usually via email.
2. problem definition & definition of project scope: together, our project coordination team and you work out what exactly the challenge is that you are facing and whether it can be solved using data science techniques. If this is the case, we scope the project, i.e. we roughly define what will be done as part of the project. This phase usually takes 1-4 weeks, depending on the problem.
3. call for applications & team selection and onboarding
4. kickoff 
5. project work
6. handover 
7. follow-up 


## FAQ
### How much does it cost?
CorrelAid is a non-profit organisation that enables data4good projects by connecting social organisations with data scientists - we do not make any profit with our projects. Our data scientists are skilled volunteers who volunteer their time and skills for free because they are convinced that the potential of data science should be accessible to society. Thanks to this commitment of our data scientists, you do not pay them for their work. However, in most cases, you need to provide travel and accomodation to our project team members for the kickoff workshop. You also need to provide the location for this workshop. Those expenses usually amount to 500-1000 Euro.
