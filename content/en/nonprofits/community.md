## CorrelCon
Every November, our digital conference offers attendees the opportunity to attend talks and workshops related to data, data science, and Data4Good, and to network with other data enthusiasts. All materials are publicly available after the conference - click [here](https://docs.correlaid.org/correlcollection/correlcon).

## Conferences
We also advocate for the digital needs of civil society at external events: upcoming dates are posted in [our calendar](/en/events/).
Are you still looking for speakers for your event?
We are happy to support you with presentations and workshops on Data4Good. Feel free to reach out to Nina.
