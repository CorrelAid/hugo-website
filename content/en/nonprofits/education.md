At CorrelAid e.V., we are not only committed to the idea of using data for good, but also firmly believe in sharing knowledge. This is why "education" has become our legal purpose. We offer a wide range of educational formats for nonprofits and volunteers. In addition, we share our knowledge, code and other material publicly whenever data protection guidelines allow us to do so.


## Data hour

Every Thursday afternoon we offer an opportunity for nonprofits to talk about their data challenges of any kind. You have questions and would like to talk to a data analyst? Arrange your 30-minute meeting [here](https://calendly.com/correlaid/30min).

## Workshops
### Impact measurement
In this course, participants learn how social organizations develop impact chains and impact indicators. During the workshop we will work with illustrative examples, directly transferable instruments, jointly design impact chains and talk about the current state of impact measurement in Germany.

**Learning objectives:**

### Data strategy
In this course, participants learn how data and technology enable evidence-based and completely new ways of working. We will present case studies from our work, give an introduction to tools that social organizations can use to develop their own data strategy and conduct initial data analyses. 

**Learning objectives:**
- Participants have an understanding of the potential of data and data analysis in general.
- Participants are able to recognize the potential and potential obstacles of data analysis in their organizations.
- Participants can perform simple data analyses and create visualizations.
