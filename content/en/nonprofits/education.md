At CorrelAid e.V., we are not only committed to the idea of using data for good, but also firmly believe in sharing knowledge. This is why "education" has become our legal purpose. We offer a wide range of educational formats for nonprofits and volunteers. In addition, we share our knowledge, code and other material publicly whenever data protection guidelines allow us to do so.


## Data hour

Every Thursday afternoon we offer an opportunity for nonprofits to talk about their data challenges of any kind. You have questions and would like to talk to a data analyst? Arrange your 30-minute meeting [here](https://calendly.com/correlaid/30min).
