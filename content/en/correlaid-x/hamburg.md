Moin! 
The goal of our Local Chapter Hamburg is to support non-profit organizations in the Hamburg area with data projects, offer workshops, knowledge exchange and networking.

We are united by our interest in data science and the world of making the world a little bit better, otherwise we have a diverse background. Therefore we are looking for all interested people, no matter if you are already working, student or something else. Also your current programming skills are secondary, together we can learn and develop.

If you are interested, please subscribe to our newsletter or write an e-mail.
