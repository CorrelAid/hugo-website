Stuttgart - the heart of the innovation location Baden-Württemberg, not far from the Tübingen "Cyber Valley". These are ideal conditions for a CorrelAid local chapter, so that not only Daimler, Bosch and Co. but also small, non-profit organizations can benefit from the know-how of (prospective) data analysts. 

We are building a network in which we can exchange our knowledge, offer workshops, discussion rounds and challenges, and support non-profit organizations in the Stuttgart area with local projects. 
We are currently building up our local group and are looking for people of all levels - no matter if you are already working or just finished your very first statistics course at the university, you are very welcome! 
We are currently developing our own structures for our work, so you have the opportunity to contribute your ideas, take responsibility and actively participate in the local group. But we also welcome everyone who just wants to get a taste of what we do or who wants to benefit from an introductory course in R or Python. 
Just subscribe to our newsletter or send us an email directly!

Micha is studying Communication Science at the University of Hohenheim, but does not want to become an Instagram Influencer. Instead, he is enthusiastic about empirical research and data analysis and is trying to get away from the university's SPSS - although he has developed a certain love-hate relationship with it. He has been following the work of CorrelAid for some time now, and since the beginning of 2020 he has also wanted to become active himself.
