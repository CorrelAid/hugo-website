We're a group of more than 20 active CorrelAid network members. We meet regularly to code and learn R and Python and brainstorm ideas for projects with local NGOs.
We also organize MeetUps like the [Data Dialogue](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/CorrelAid/events/264806335).

If you want to participate or get in contact with us, just write us an e-mail to berlin@correlaid.org!
