Hello to all data science peeps located in East Germany! We are CorrelAid’s chapter in Leipzig!

Since we have all spent the vast majority of our time in 2020 in front of our small, big, or medium sized screens, we thought it would be a great idea to prolong our screen time just a little bit more. The purpose of our undertaking: carrying on the spirit of CorrelAid that is providing data science for a good cause.
Luckily, a heterogeneous and lively group has formed right away. We started to have monthly virtual gatherings while we are planning to come together in the real world asap. Professionals, nerds, and noobs alike, anyone is welcome - we are diverse and enthusiastic.

Sounds appealing? We will always be looking for fresh minds who are willing to join our network in which we share our knowledge, skills, ideas, and – of course - our precious screen time. Feel free to reach out to us, we are looking forward to meet you!
You are a NPO or a NGO? We provide no-cost data services to organizations with a positive social mission. Feel free to reach out to us via mail!

Through my studies studies in Psychology and Sociology I am in touch with quantitative Data on a daily basis. Once I was introduced to R I was ultimately hooked. Currently, I am focussing on further improving my Data Science skills. CorrelAid provides an opportunity for me to apply my knowledge and at the same time commit to a greater cause.

Clemens is an undergraduate in Psychology and currently studies Sociology with a focus on digital and quantitative methods.

Alex is an absolute beginner in the world of data, so don’t expect him to code like a real pro. Yet, data seems to connect the dots in his mind. As a generalist, he is always passionate about the big picture. Up to now, Tableau was his only companion to create vizzes and answer his questions from data. With the lovely group of CorrelAid this will change and empower him to even serve the good cause. Currently he is doing his Master’s degree at the Chair of Energy Management and Sustainability at University of Leipzig.
