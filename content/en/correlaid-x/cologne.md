Kölle Alaaf! Join us on our quest to leverage the potential of data science for good in and around Cologne! Founded in 2020 we are one of the newest chapters bringing together people who are interested in data for a socially just and ecological sustainable future.

We are building a local community in which we can exchange our knowledge, develop new skills, share the latest data science innovations and support non-profit organizations in and around Cologne. We meet regularly to code and learn R and Python and brainstorm ideas for projects. 

Our chapter appreciates every kind of support. No matter your background or (technical) skill set, there are plenty of opportunities to actively engage. We are currently developing our local structures. You have the opportunity to contribute your ideas, take responsibility and actively participate in the founding of a local group. 

Become an ambassador for ethics and awareness in data science in our local chapter community.

If you are an NPO from in and around Cologne that has ideas for a project or that just has some interesting data that you don’t quite know how to make use of, please reach out to us.

I am a PhD candidate in social psychology at the University Heidelberg. Currently I work at the German Development Institute in Bonn, where I apply behavioural theories in field experiments to motivate consumers around the globe to act sustainably. Through CorrelAid I want to use my knowledge and skills for the greater good in local projects.

Florian, just finished my Masters in politcal science. Became addicted to programming with R in university - there' s a package for everything! Besides trying to get a foot into the data science world I want to build a non-profit and democratic data science community in Cologne where everyone feels welcome. See you on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-gilberg/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Studentenfutter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Studentenfutter">GitHub</a> or our next Meetup!

I am an applied econometrician and PhD candidate at the Ruhr-University Bochum. I enjoy working with geospatial data and on the exploration of the potential of machine learning methods in economic research. I prefer Python over every other language. Through CorrelAid I hope to connect and exchange with other data people and to create some positive impact on society.
