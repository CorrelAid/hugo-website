In May 2020 we have established the CorrelAid local chapter Munich. So far, we are a small group of about 12 enthusiastic people with a wide variety of backgrounds, all of whom share a keen interest in data science. By helping others with our experience and knowledge, we want to contribute something to society together. We are meeting regularly (for now online) and would be thrilled if you would be interested to join us.
