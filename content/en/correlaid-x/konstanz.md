CorrelAid has almost become a tradition in Konstanz!

As the "birthplace" of CorrelAid, the small university town on the lake has always had a large circle of data science enthusiastic students. In order to fill this tradition with life, the Local Chapter Konstanz was founded in 2019 and has since then organized several R-workshops, data roundtables and data hackdays in cooperation with the data journalism team of SWR. Also a project with the NPO "Studieren ohne Grenzen" (Study without borders) could be realized.

A close cooperation with the Open-Data Portal of the City of Konstanz is planned for 2020. 
As you can see, Konstanz has not only CorrelAid tradition, its own local chapter and a lake to offer, but also a great Data4Good future.

So feel free to contact us if you want to join us or just have a look.

Nico is currently studying his Bachelor's degree in political and administrative sciences. The combination of this degree and a keen interest in Data Science for Good inevitably led to his involvement with CorrelAid.
