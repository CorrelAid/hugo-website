**Which path did you choose at Dataquest? What did you hope to achieve with this path?**

Data Scientist in Python. I hope to achieve a better insight and understanding of Python and be able to use Python effectively in data analysis in the future.

**Do you have any advice for someone who is considering Dataquest?**

Work along the path and keep at it and don't be discouraged by failures.

**Tell us what you are most proud of after learning with Dataquest?**

That my daughter has started to be interested in coding.

**Which path did you choose at Dataquest? What did you hope to achieve with this path?**

Machine Learning - to get a deeper understanding of math and concepts beyond application.

**What do you like about learning at Dataquest?**

I really like the self-paced learning at Dataquest.

**What new skills did you learn with Dataquest? How did it feel once you mastered these skills?**

I’ve learned a lot about Machine Learning up to now - that’s goood :) 

**Do you have any advice for someone who is considering Dataquest?**

Short and simple: just do it!

**Which path did you choose at Dataquest? What did you hope to achieve with this path?**

I chose the Data Engineering Path: I have not formally studied Computer Science so it's interesting to me to learn about some of the basic concepts like how information is stored in computers or the big O notation.

**What do you like about learning at Dataquest?**

I liked that you also have projects at the end of a section. They are always very time consuming but that's also a really good way to apply what I learned theoretically and find out how to overcome all the little things that come along in real life.

**Did Dataquest help you with your job?**

It helped me to decide which direction I want my career to take, because I could gain skills in one area over a longer time period and then feel confident to take on tasks in that area in my job.

**Do you have any advice for someone who is considering Dataquest?**

Decide on a path, set a specific time and place where you want to learn each day and then show up. Over time you will get better by "just" showing up. But don't be fooled, even carving out ten minutes a day is a lot tougher than you might think.

**Which path did you choose at Dataquest? What did you hope to achieve with this path?**

I chose “Data Scientist in Python” - I had basic Python knowledge already and even worked with Data Science / ML packages, but wanted to refresh my skills. I also really benefited from the part of the course in SQL, which is a highly demanded skill I had little experience with before.

**What do you like about learning at Dataquest?**

It definitely helped me to be confident about and actually be able to show my programming skills, which probably helped me for my job interviews. I liked the very interactive way the courses were set up.

**What new skills did you learn with Dataquest? How did it feel once you mastered these skills?**

Nothing was absolutely new to me and it was more of a refresher. Also to master something I feel it is necessary to pursue a longer-term project with a real outcome such as a thesis or a work project.
