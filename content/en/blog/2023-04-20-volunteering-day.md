Since 2015, our volunteers have already supported a total of 59 civil society organizations in 78 projects - these and other internal projects were made possible by 366 volunteers in the process. In addition to our Data4Good projects, volunteering makes so much more possible: a mentoring program, TidyTuesday office hours, a book club, public relations and PR, over ten local groups that bring our engagement to the local level, countless workshops for volunteers and nonprofits, "R Lernen" as a data course that has now taken place six times. Thank you for the time and commitment that goes into this work! And of course, a huge thank you to our volunteer board and ethics committee - thank you for your tireless efforts to keep CorrelAid moving forward!

A total of 2,400 volunteers are behind CorrelAid, helping nonprofit organizations to pursue their mission even more effectively. CorrelAiders invest an average of four hours a week in project work - in addition to their jobs, studies and everyday life. The passion and energy that each individual puts into our projects and initiatives are worth their weight in gold!

These socially relevant projects and initiatives could only be implemented thanks to the volunteers. Each volunteer invests their time to make things happen and bring their spirit to the table. CorrelAid and our partner organizations only exist through the collaboration and intrinsic motivation of dedicated volunteers who drive projects forward in long meetings and organize and coordinate on their own. This day is here to celebrate us for our commitment and activities and that is why we say THANK YOU, to all the people who tirelessly support #Data4Good!

We thank all the volunteers,
who were active in projects, for their time and effort,
who, in stressful phases of their lives, still have an hour or two to spare for CorrelAid,
tackling things, even when challenges await,
address the issues and overcome differences for the project and our mission,

and last but not least, we would like to thank all the representatives from the partner organizations for the good cooperation in the various projects!
And furthermore, we must not forget: Every volunteer, also in the Data4Good area, fills a gap in social need that cannot be met without the commitment of our network members.
