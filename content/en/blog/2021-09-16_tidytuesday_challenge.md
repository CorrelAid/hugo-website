On 9 September 2021, [Citizens For Europe](https://citizensforeurope.org/), an NGO and dear friend of CorrelAid, have published a policy paper entitled "Wähler*innen mit Migrationshintergrund als wahlentscheidender Faktor. Ihr potentieller Einfluss auf die Bundestagswahl 2021". In cooperation with Citizens for Europe, [Arndt Leininger](https://aleininger.eu/) (long-time member of CorrelAid and assistant professor for political science research methods at Chemnitz University of Technology) and [Julius Lagodny](https://www.juliuslagodny.com/) (PhD candidate in political science at Cornell University) have for the first time estimated how influential the voices of people with a migration background can be on the upcoming national elections in Germany. To do so, they used the German micro census to estimate the number of eligible voters with an immigrant background for each of the 299 federal electoral districts. They estimate that the share of eligible voters with a migration background stands at 12.2 per cent of the eligible population, which corresponds to at least 74 seats in the Bundestag. At present, however, only 58 members of the Bundestag have a migration background. Furthermore, it turns out that in many constituencies, eligible voters with a migration background can make the difference: their number in more than half of the constituencies exceeds the number of votes that lie between the first- and second-place direct candidates.

In August, Citizens for Europe, Arndt and Julius had provided their dataset exclusively for CorrelAid's first TidyTuesday inspired DataViz Challenge - a challenge inspired by the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) R community project - organised and hosted by Andreas Neumann and Long Nguyen. The dataset that participants worked with included contained information on the number of eligible voters with a migration background, the number of residents with a migration background overall, the results of the 2017 Bundestag election, and socioeconomic and demographic structural data for each of Germany's 299 constituencies for the national election. The dataset, especially in combination with [shapefiles provided by the Federal Returning Officer](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/2017/wahlkreiseinteilung/downloads.html), offers a wide range of possibilities for data visualizations.

The participants of the #tidytuesday inspired challenge created a great many data visualizations with a visual "wow" and a political "aha" factor. While some of these visualizations are featured as figures in the policy paper, there were simply to many good visualizations to include them all. Hence, in this blog post, we showcase some of the visualizations that participants created and let their creators explain them. If you want to have a go at the data yourself, it is freely available at [Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GPEV4P). 

## Visualizing the potential electoral power of resident aliens and underage Germans with migration background as a parliamentary group in the Bundestag

This plot, which is also included in the [policy paper](https://vielfaltentscheidet.de/waehlerinnen-mit-migrationshintergrund-als-wahlentscheidender-faktor/), visualizes the potential electoral power of resident aliens who are not (yet?) able to vote because they lack citizenship. More than half of residents in Germany lack citizenship, although many of them have been living in the country for many years or even decades. They might vote in the future if they acquire German citizenship, possibly after regulations have been liberalized or if voting rights are extended to resident aliens. Additionally, there are many Germans with migration background who are simply not yet old enough to vote. They will be able to vote in the future. Both of these groups together represent not yet realized but future potential of residents with a migration background. To visualize this potential, we proceeded as follows: First, we obtained the absolute vote counts for the party lists nationwide ("Zweitstimme) from the official national result of the 2017 Bundestag election. In a second step, we added the number of resident aliens and underage Germans with a migration background to this small dataset. We then calculated the seat distribution that would follow from these numbers in a 598 seat parliament. We chose the minimum size of 598 because it is hard to predict how many seats parliament will comprise after the 2021 election. In making these calculations, we obviously make the grossly simplifying that all these currently non-eligible citizens will be eligible in the future, will all vote and vote for the same party. We make this assumption simply for visualizing the size of the group.

We created the plot using R and the packages `ggplot2` and `ggparliament`. The latter provides the functionality to draw 'parliament plots' that mimic the layout of actual national parliaments, such as the German Bundestag or the UK House of Commons. We have no GitHub repository for the code, but it is available upon request.

## Unleashing the full electoral potential of voters of immigrant origin-a case study for Germany

In this highly hypothetical thought experiment we assume the following:

* there exists a migrant party -all voters with migrant background share homogenous political alignments
* all voters of immigrant origin vote for the migrant party
* only the first votes (“Erststimmen”) were being assessed. With the first vote, an electorate can vote the MP directly into parliament. Hence, the contestant with the highest number of votes wins the seat in parliament

The top left plot highlights the first scenario in which all voters of migrant descend who are eligible to vote, actually vote for migrant party. In 4 constituencies, the number of votes given to the migrant party would outnumber the party with the highest share of votes in 2017, namely

Constituency        |Party                                            |No. of votes |Migrant party votes|
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
|Berlin Mitte          | Social Democratic Party (SPD)      | 35036 votes |53602 votes         |
|DuisburgII            |Social Democratic Party (SPD)       | 34799 votes |37339 votes         |
|Frankfurt a. Main I|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)|43663 votes  |58684 votes         |
|Augsburg Stadt    | Christian Social Union (CSU)         |52769 votes   |62766 votes        |

In the second scenario we added non-eligible voters of migrant descend in our evaluation (i.e. minors). This time, the migrant party would win additional 146 seats. In total:

- 35MPs would represent Baden-Wurttemberg, 
- Bavaria: 14MPs, 
- Berlin: 10MPs, 
- Bremen: 2MPs, 
- Hamburg: 6MPs, 
- Hesse: 18MPs, 
- Lower-Saxony: 8MPs, 
- North Rhine-Westfalia: 45MPs, 
- Rhineland-Palatinate: 8MPs, 
- Saarland: 2MPs 
- and 2MPs would come from Schleswig-Holstein.

## Exploring the Migrazensus data 

As I explored the Migrazensus data, as part of August's Correlaid TidyTuesday event, I put together three visualisations showing: 



1. How many people with a "migration background" live in each German region, and the proportion of these people who are eligible to vote;

2. How the votes of people with a "migration background" translate into seats in the Bundestag;

3. And, where political parties could gain district seats by winning the votes of more people with a "migration background".

[Here is the repo with my R code, graphic design files and a QGIS project](https://github.com/tbk03/tidy_tuesday_correlaid), basically everything I used while exploring the data and producing the visualisations. Sorry the repo is a bit of mess, but I hope it gives some insights into the exploratory processes I apply when visualizing data. It would be a bit misleading if I posted some polished R code, when I tend to use ggplot2 to produce the basis of visualisations before exporting these into graphic design software (Affinity Designer/Publisher at the moment).

A less serious take on exploring the Migrazensus data. This latitudinal ridgeline plot is inspired by some of the more artistic terrain elevation maps. Here, the height of the "peaks" corresponds to the density of persons with a migration background who are not eligible to vote in the population.

Unsurprisingly ¯\\\_ (ツ)_/¯ the constituencies with the highest percentages of non-eligible voters with a migration background are in big cities: Frankfurt am Main I (40.4%), Berlin-Mitte (36.1%), Stuttgart II (35.2%), München-Nord (33.4%), and Leverkusen – Köln IV (32.7%).

## In how many constituencies could eligible citizens with a migration background make a difference?

This plot, which is also included in the [policy paper](https://vielfaltentscheidet.de/waehlerinnen-mit-migrationshintergrund-als-wahlentscheidender-faktor/), visualizes the potential electoral power of eligible citizens with a migration background in the constituencies ("Erststimme"). About 12% of eligible citizens have a migration background. For each constituency, we checked whether the number of eligible voters with a migration background exceeds the difference in votes between the first and second-placed direct candidates in the last Bundestag election. It turns out that in 167 of 299 constituencies, citizens with a migration background could make the difference who wins or loses a district. We visualize which districts these are on a map. Of course, eligible voters with a migration background could already vote for both the first and the second party, and some of them did, of course. Nevertheless, we include all eligible voters with a migration background, including those who actually voted, in the calculation of the power potential, because it is, of course, possible for the parties to convince both citizens with a migration background who voted or have not yet voted to defend or win a direct mandate. We make these simplifying assumptions to provide an intuitive understanding of the maximum electoral potential of citizens with a migration background.

We created the plot using R and the packages `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, and `sf`. We used `tidyr` to calculate the margin between first- and second-placed party, turning the data from wide to long format and back, and `sf` to read in the [shape files of constituencies provided by Germany's Federal Returning Officer](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/en/bundestagswahlen/2021/wahlkreiseinteilung/downloads.html). Finally, we used `ggplot2` to produce the plot. We have no GitHub repository for the code, but it is available upon request.
