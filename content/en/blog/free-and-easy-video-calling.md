## Introduction
With social (or rather: *physical*) distancing and #stayathome, it is more important than ever to stay in contact with our loved ones. While *real* visits are mostly off the table,  video calls come closest to in-person communication. But connecting to not as digitally advanced people like your grandparents can turn out to be much more difficult than expected: installing an app or creating an account can be really difficult for people who haven't done this on their own before. 

This is why we created this short guide to different app and web browser video call solutions considering compatibtability with different devices, operating systems and internet browsers, ease of setup and technical accessability. 

We tested everything out ourselves in an hour-long session using multiple tablets, laptops and smartphones - trying to simulate every scenario possible. Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of all available tools. Hopefully your scenario is included, too! If not, feel free to drop us an [email](mailto:info@correlaid.org) and we'll extend this guide!

## Overview

Here's the high-level overview over all solutions we tested. A more detailed description can be found below.

## Classic Options: Messengers  {#messengers}
If you have a **smartphone or tablet with sim card** your go-to options for video calling are the messengers FaceTime (iOS only),  WhatsApp, or Signal (no group video chat). 

They are easiest and most stable to use and compatible with most devices and operating systems. 

If the person you want to call has a **Apple iPhone or iPad without sim card**, FaceTime still works.
For Android devices without a SIM card, there is also the possibility to register for WhatsApp using your landline phone number (German: "Festnetznummer"): you'll then be called from WhatsApp and a roboter voice will tell you the confirmation code that is needed to complete the registration process. However, this requires to install WhatsApp from a third-party website that offers a "hacked" WhatsApp as APK (google: "WhatsApp APK"), so this is definitely not recommended from a security perspective. 
Unfortunately, there's no way to use WhatsApp on an iPad as of now that does not involve downloading shady third-party apps etc. 


## Web Browser and App Solutions
