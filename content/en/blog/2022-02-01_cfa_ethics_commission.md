We are looking for candidates for the new CorrelAid Ethics commission! Candidates will be up for election in the next general assembly which will take place on **March** **18th, 6:30pm (Berlin time).**


## How would you support CorrelAid?



* you help ensure that CorrelAid activities live up to the high ethical standards and maintain and develop artifacts related to (data) ethics and ethical conduct within CorrelAid (e.g. code of conduct)
* your main task will be the regular review of CorrelAid project ideas with regards to data ethics standards
* time commitment: probably 1h meeting every two-four weeks + time to write statements + time to work on/maintain documents. In total approx. 2-6 hours per month, depending on number of incoming projects/requests.


## What do you get out of it?



* you discuss and decide on real problems that will affect what we do in CorrelAid
* you engage with the community to co-create the ethical standards and values that we want to stick by.
* you learn from and with the other members of the commission
* you get involved in the core team of CorrelAid and learn more about the “behind the scenes”


## Who are we looking for?

We are looking for people with an analytical pragmatic mindset and a strong moral compass who are not afraid to make difficult decisions.

You share the mission of CorrelAid and the ideas, values and principles outlined in our[ code of conduct](https://correlaid.org/about/codeofconduct/). Ideally, you have been part of a CorrelAid Data4Good project or participated in other CorrelAid activities (e.g. local chapters, workshops). Experience with working in an ethics committee would be a bonus but is by no means required.

You are able to dedicate the time required until the end of the year / the next general assembly.

**Important**: to become a member of the ethics commission, you have to be a member of the association CorrelAid e.V. Learn more about becoming a member[ here](https://correlaid.org/en/become-member/).


## What is the CorrelAid ethics commission?

The ethics commission is an official body of the association CorrelAid e.V. Members are elected for a year by the general assembly of CorrelAid e.V. The commission checks ethical aspects of activities of CorrelAid e.V. It can be called upon by everyone, be they volunteer, project partner, or an outside individual.

The main task of the ethics commission will be to review certain, potentially problematic project ideas to determine whether they meet our ethical guidelines and values. In addition, they’ll also get active with regards to other activities whenever someone calls upon them. If the commission deems an activity / project not to be in line with our ethical standards, the activity needs to be abandoned / stopped.

In addition to this review responsibility, the ethics commission will take care of the[ Code of Conduct](https://correlaid.org/about/codeofconduct/) and other relevant documents, e.g the[ project decision guide](https://docs.correlaid.org/project-manual/project-decision-guide).


## Why are we establishing the ethics commission?

Ethical discussions and reflections on what we do, why we do it and how we want to do it have always been a part of CorrelAids core identity. For instance, we have long tried to find a definite answer to the question: “who do we do projects with under which circumstances?”. In the end, we found that the answer was “it depends on the specific case”.

In other areas, it was easier to write down clear guidelines. For instance, we have formulated values and expectations on how we want to work together within CorrelAid in our [Code of Conduct](https://correlaid.org/about/codeofconduct). 

The responsibility for establishing and guiding those discussions and making those decisions has been carried by volunteers since CorrelAid’s founding in 2015. Since 2020, our full time employees - having the time resources to do so - have worked more and more on those topics. However, we do believe that ethical standards and decisions are way too important to be made by just three employees. Instead, with the ethics commission, we aim to establish a democratically legitimized body within CorrelAids official structure, the association CorrelAid e.V. This gives everyone who wants to become involved in those topics the chance to do so by running for the ethics commission. 


## I’m interested! What’s next?

If you are interested in running for a position in the CorrelAid Ethics Commission (1 chair + 4 members) in the next general assembly meeting on March 18th, 6:30pm, write an email to our finance board member [Konstantin](mailto:finanzen@correlaid.org) with Frie (responsible for Data4Good projects) in [CC](mailto:frie.p@correlaid.org).
