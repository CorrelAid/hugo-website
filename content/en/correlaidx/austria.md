Our Austrian chapter is still in the founding phase, so besides pittoresque ski resorts, rustic cuisine and the Opera in Vienna, you will also find a small, but motivated group of people who live for Data4Good in Austria.
Our goal is to offer low-threshold help and to help local organizations in a sustainable way.
If you are interested, please contact Tilman (Vienna) or Felix (Linz)!

Tilman joined CorrelAid in 2019 - first with the local chapter in Konstanz and now landed in Vienna and thus at the Austrian chapter through his Master's degree in Data Science. He believes that not only big companies should benefit through and from data.
His focus is on Data Management, Data Collection and Natural Language Processing.
