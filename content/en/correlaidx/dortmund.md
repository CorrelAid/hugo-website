Besides BVB, beer and a "Tatort" series, Dortmund has an own statistics faculty and the first Data Science study programme in Germany. 

Based on this potential, we started building a local chapter in the beginning of 2017 and started the chapter in February 2018 with a Kickoff-Event. Folks interested in Data Science from all North Rhine-Westphalia met to spend an afternoon to discuss the role of data in society, to participate in exciting workshops, and to initiate the Local Chapter Ruhr area.

In workshops, we discussed possibilities of Data Science, how Machine Learning works (and can be realized in R), and how to build fancy, interactive graphs with the data visualization tool Tableau. Our speaker from "Wissenschaftsladen Dortmund" provided critical input regarding encryption and the role of data in civil society. A first local project can possibly be initiated in cooperation with the "Wissenschaftsladen Dortmund" who, for example, provide free WiFi for refugee homes.
