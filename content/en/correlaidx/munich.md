In May 2020 we have established the CorrelAid local chapter Munich. So far, we are a small group of about 12 enthusiastic people with a wide variety of backgrounds, all of whom share a keen interest in data science. By helping others with our experience and knowledge, we want to contribute something to society together. We are meeting regularly (for now online) and would be thrilled if you would be interested to join us.

Pia is currently studying Mathematics at the TUM, where she is focussing on data science topics. At the beginning of 2020, she discovered CorrelAid and immediately wanted to bring a local chapter to Munich.

Daniel is studying mathematics at the Technical University of Munich and is one of the contact persons for the Munich region. The idea of getting together and sharing ideas to learn and help others with data science excites him about CorrelAid.
