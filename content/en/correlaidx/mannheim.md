The Local Chapter Mannheim was founded with a kick-off event at the University of Mannheim in the fall of 2017. Since then, we have held introductory workshops on R and Python for students, worked together with student initiatives at the university of Mannheim and hosted a panel discussion on risks and benefits of open data in the government context. With these events, we hope to make CorrelAid Mannheim a relevant voice in the space of Data for Good in the Rhein-Neckar region. Furthermore, we worked together with Non-Profit Organizations in local projects to help them gain new insights into their work using their own data.
If you want to help us with this, you can subscribe to our [newsletter](https://kutt.it/correlaidnewsletter), send us an email at [mannheim@correlaid.org](mailto:mannheim@correlaid.org) and join the discussion in our slack.

Do you represent a Non-Profit organization in the Rhein-Neckar region and are interested in working with us? Send us an e-mail at [mannheim@correlaid.org](mailto:mannheim@correlaid.org).

Konstantin is part of CorrelAid since...forever and works on his PhD at the University of Mannheim. He's fascinated by seemingly unstructured data that still often holds a lot of information to solve problems. The motivation to work for CorrelAid stems  from the positive reactions of the project team and the partner organisations.

Joshua is currently studying Applied Computer Science in Heidelberg and discovered his enthusiasm for data science and statistics early on. But he is not only passionate about digging into the mountains of data, he also climbs them in nature. Since April 2020 he is the contact person for LC-Mannheim.
