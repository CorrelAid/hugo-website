It all started when few data scientists in Karlsruhe came together and decided to leverage their skills for the good of the community and that's how CorrelAidX Karlsruhe was born. 

We plan to hold workshops for python and data science enthusiasts, organise informational talks and help NPOâ€™s achieve their objectives using data science.
Keep looking for our next events in our [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/dataforgood-correlaid-karlsruhe/) or simply reach out to us via email.
