Switzerland! Home of chocolate, fondue, and data science! Since 2017 a network of Swiss-based data scientists have volunteered their skills and time to advance socially-positive outcomes. In late 2020 we partnered with CorrelAid to found CorrelAid Switzerland.
 
We work with non-profits and socially-conscious organisations, to help them use their data to increase their impact. Our network collects data scientists with wide-ranging experience, from students to seasoned professionals. In addition to data science projects, we run educational events, social meetups and hack sessions.
 
CorrelAid Switzerland provides no-cost data science services to non-profits and organisations with a positive social mission, with the explicit goal of deploying and maintaining services for long-lasting impact for the non-profit.
 
We are currently expanding our core team, and always looking for people willing to help organise! Please get in contact with us if you’d like to join up.
 
Specific current needs:
* Marketing and social media lead
* Funding business development lead
* Event organiser lead
