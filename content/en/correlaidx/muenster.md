Hi, we are CorrelAid Münster! Besides students and bicycles, there is now also a brand new CorrelAid chapter in Münster. As a link between student initiatives, the startup scene and non-profits, we contribute to using technology and data for the common good and are committed to a local open data culture. In doing so, we rely heavily on interdisciplinary collaboration, in the form of workshops, hackathons, lectures and projects. Are you interested in being part of the local CorrelAid project in Münster? Then get in touch, we offer many opportunities to support or realise your own ideas (even without IT skills). You are part of a non-profit organisation in Münster and you are interested in a cooperation? Then get in touch and we can discuss possible project ideas directly.

I am currently studying Information Systems at the WWU Münster and work as an RPA developer. In my studies, I already dealt with applied data science in sustainability research and am now trying to continue this, among other things, through my involvement here at CorrelAid. When I found out that there was no CorrelAid chapter in Münster yet, I decided to take things into my own hands and bring CorrelAid to Münster. I am excited to see where this journey will take us!
