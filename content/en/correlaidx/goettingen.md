The local chapter CorrelAid X Göttingen was founded at the beginning of 2019. Göttingen is a very large study location 
with a wide variety of study focuses, which is why it is a good opportunity to successfully continue our mission here 
as well. We want to establish a core of CorrelAid members in Göttingen in order to make a long-term difference on a 
local level. Our next objectives are to start a first project and to offer workshops for Data Science beginners in 
Python and R. We are looking forward to seeing you!
