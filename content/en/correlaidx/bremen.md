The local chapter in Bremen, which was prompted in context of a Kick-Off meeting in Berlin, was established in the 
end of 2018. Through people-to-people contact, several interested people from the department of sociology and 
informatics participated in the first meeting that brought the actual foundation process on its way. 

By now, a core team has been developed which regularly meets in the conference room of the University’s General 
Students Committee (AStA). For the near future we decided to establish new contacts with socially-oriented 
initiatives in Bremen and „umzu“. Secondly, we would like to create a network for local data analysts. 
For this purpose we aim to build a strong cooperation with different faculties and departments at the 
University of Bremen.

Our team appreciates every kind of support. Especially students and staff from the Hochschule Bremen, 
Jacobs University or the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS) are very welcome 
to participate. If you are interested in implementing your own project, simply sign up for our newsletter 
(specifying the area your living at would be advantageous). In case you would like to take part in the organizational
 unit, please send an email to Hendrik.
