We are a group of data science enthusiasts from all over the Netherlands, who have started Stichting CorrelAid Nederland, an organisation that has the goal of connecting data scientists with organisations and foundations that advance the Social Good. 
These data scientists could either be students in a quantitative field that want to apply their skills on real world problems, or professionals who want to do something meaningful outside of their day job. All this happens on a volunteer basis.
 
Stichting CorrelAid Nederland is inspired by, and in contact with, CorrelAid which was originally founded in Germany.

If you are interested in CorrelAid Nederland or you want to get involved in our network: go to our [website](https://correlaid.nl), [mail](mailto:andrew.sutjahjo@correlaid.org) [one](mailto:fabian.dablander@correlaid.org) [of](mailto:yiran.g@correlaid.org) [us](mailto:netherlands@correlaid.org), or subscribe to our mailing list.

During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an
orphanage in Kenya. Two years in, he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and
network to try to do good again once he had more experience. He has since then
worked as a data scientist at Capgemini, United Wardrobe, and Utelly specializing in NLP,
Search, and Recommendation Systems. After seeing how much more impact we can
have with data, he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good.

Joel graduated from his master program in political science at University of Gothenburg in summer 2018.
Afterwards, he moved to Utrecht and started with several other passionate data scientists a local CorrelAid chapter in the Netherlands. Currently, he is living in Berlin. 
We are curious if we can transfer the concept of "data for good" on another cultural context and are excited for the first local chapter beyond Germany.
