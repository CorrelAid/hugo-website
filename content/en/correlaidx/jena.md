Despite its rather small size, Jena has developed in recent years into a scientific gem with a penchant for innovation in the heart of Thuringia.
The city is not only the main location of the Zeiss company, but is also home to countless research institutions, such as the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena, the Ernst Abbe University of Applied Sciences, the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, the Leibniz Institute for Photonic Technologies, the Michael Stifel Center and the DLR Institute for Data Science.

In this rich environment, our local CorrelAid group was founded in 2021 to provide an open exchange platform for all interested people, students, PhD students, researchers or other professionals from a wide range of disciplines and fields of work. The goal of our voluntary group is to pool our skills and to jointly master current challenges for the common good.

If you are interested in tackling interdisciplinary problems together, want to get to know interesting projects or have an exciting task of your own, this is the right place for you and you are always welcome. 

We are looking forward to meeting you.

After studying media science, philosophy and psychology, Elisa earned her doctorate in economics - with a strong inclination towards behavioral economics. As a research associate at the University of Jena, she conducts research on topics related to human behavior as individuals, in groups, and in organizations. She has been involved with CorrelAid since the fall of 2020. In her private life, the trilogy of data, media and sustainability makes Elisa's heart beat faster.

Torsten studied mathematics at the Humboldt-Universität Berlin and was a Wilkinson post-doc at Argonne National Laboratory for two years after his PhD.
Since 2017, he has been working at the Chair of Advanced Computing and teaches various lectures
in the Computational and Data Science program at FSU Jena.
When he is not sunk behind his computer screen developing new mathematical theories or algorithms, he can be found SUPing on the river Saale, at a pool table, on his motorcycle, or over one of his beer brewing kettles.
