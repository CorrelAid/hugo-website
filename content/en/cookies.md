# Cookies


### What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files we will save on your computer. They are designed in such a way, that they will collect small amounts of client- and website-specific data. Usually, they only consist of a word or a number, which can be accessed by either the web server or the client's computer. This allows our servers to create a personalised website for visitors. Alternatively, the website itself contains a script that retrieves the information stored in the cookie and adjusts the website to your needs whenever you access it. In our case, we only use cookies to store whether you have toggled a notification bar.

### Why do we use cookies?

We primarily use cookies to enhance user experience on our website. **All our cookies will be deleted automatically, once you close your browser**. Neither do we use cookies to track your behaviour, nor do we allow third party providers to place cookies on our website. To ensure utmost transparency on which cookies we use and what we use them for, we created the following list:
