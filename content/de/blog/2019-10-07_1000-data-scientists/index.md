When we started in 2015 we were only a handful of people wondering: How many others could we bring together with the idea to use data science for the common good? Four years later we can say there are at least 1000 other data scientists. In the last year alone our network grew by almost 70%.

The key question back then and the one question we get asked the most today is: “how on earth do you find so many people who voluntarily do statistics and wrangle data in their free time?”

While the background and initial motivation of people joing us might vary, we found that there is one thing we all have in common.

Everyone we meet from the community has a passion for what they do. Everyone is fasciniated by the things we can do with data and the potential it holds - regardless of academic background, years of experience, and physical location.

We are now 1000 data scientists convinced that data, statistics and tech should benefit society as a whole. 1000 data scientists eager to share and learn. 1000 data scientists who absolutly love what they do.

Now the question is what can we, as a network, achieve? What impact can 1000 voluntary data scientists have? It is time to think big. We would love to hear your ideas about new projects, concepts and events. Just drop Johannes a message ([johannes.m@correlaid.org](mailto:johannes.m@correlaid.org)).
