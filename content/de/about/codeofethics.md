# Code of Ethics

*This document defines the key values that we want to work by.*
_If you want to contribute to the Code of Ethics, you can leave comments in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1El97UMEm2ySAOIRM0sula6mMXQHZoGo8LIz8OFgtx1w/edit?usp=sharing)._

CorrelAid is an independent, inclusive community dedicated to education. We enable data analysts and scientists to apply their knowledge in Data4Good projects supporting institutions and organisations.

While doing so, we take a stand against all forms of discrimination. We show deep commitment to encouraging equality in our teams and transparency in our work and beyond. We aim to dismantle structures that uphold oppression and bias and move towards equity, respect and understanding.

We strive to make our community an open and welcoming environment by aiming towards an discrimination-free experience for everyone, regardless where they fall on dimensions including, but not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual identity and orientation, age, disability, neuro(a)typicality, ethnicity, profession, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, physical and mental health, or lifestyle choices.

We conduct projects with organisations, institutions and people that share our values. 

 


## Values

 

**Civil courage**

We will stand up for our values.

 

**Respect**

We are open to, respect and value other people, their time and their views as long as they are non-discriminatory and respectful.

 

**Diversity**

We embrace diversity in all its forms and take care of fostering acceptance and respect inside our community and beyond. We want everyone to feel welcome and safe within CorrelAid.

**Responsibility & data ethics**

We assume responsibility for our actions, work with care, and consider the ethical implications that might arise. When we make mistakes, we own up to them and work towards correcting them. 

**Transparency**

We are transparent in how we derive conclusions, within the CorrelAid community and with our partners. We try our best to explain methods and technologies used to empower people on their individual data journey within the CorrelAid community and with our partners.

**Pragmatism**

We create practical and sustainable solutions that have real value to our partners.

**Self-determination**

Volunteers and partners make decisions as self-determined and autonomously as possible within the scope of CorrelAids values.

**Data privacy**

Data protection and security are at the heart of our work. We commit ourselves to the regulations of the GDPR and believe that data privacy is a human right.

**Technology openness **

We do not prefer specific coding languages or technologies but rather encourage and empower our partners and members to choose a unique path for themselves.

**Open Source**

We believe in sharing our work, knowledge and experience. Therefore we make code and resources available wherever possible.
