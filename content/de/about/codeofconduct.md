# Code of Conduct


# Our commitment to society

CorrelAid is an independent and inclusive non-partisan network dedicated to education. We enable data analysts and scientists to expand and apply their knowledge to topics of social relevance by providing educational opportunities and conducting Data4Good projects. Our projects are aimed at supporting institutions in expanding their social impact by enabling them to actively participate in the digital world of data. We further strive to build a community of like-minded people to exchange knowledge and connect. While doing so, we take a stand against all forms of discrimination and show deep commitment to encouraging equality in our teams and transparency in our work and beyond.

We pledge to make our community an open and welcoming environment by ensuring an harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, age, disability, neuro(a)typicality, ethnicity, profession, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, physical and mental health, lifestyle choices or sexual identity and orientation. 

When deciding on partners to cooperate with, our ethics commission will place great emphasis on the organization’s dedication to our values, its commitment to social good and the benefit for society resulting from a potential project.


# Our working principles


### Flexibility

We guarantee that both NPOs and volunteers are able to freely dedicate their time to projects to accommodate for different needs. We believe that this enables us to get everyone involved and make the best out of the experience.


### Pragmatism

We create practical and sustainable solutions that have real value to our partners. We do so by striving to use technologies that can be implemented, used, maintained and updated by our partners, even if that means that we have to integrate less advanced tools. We foster an impact-driven mindset for the greater good.


### Professionalism

We dedicate ourselves to have high working standards and ensuring that insights derived from our analysis are profound. Data protection and security are our key concerns. We especially make sure that confidential data is treated carefully and deleted after project closure.


### Transparency

We are transparent in how we derive conclusions and try to explain methods and technologies used to our partners to empower them on their individual data journey. We also present differing views and are honest about the limitations of our knowledge and work. 


### Appreciation

We respect and value other people and their views, especially if they are different from ours. We do so by learning from each other and practicing gratitude. This can be as simple as saying ‘thank you’.


### Diversity 

We embrace diversity in all its forms and take care of fostering tolerance and acceptance inside our community and beyond.


### Knowledge sharing

What is ours is yours. We believe in sharing our work and knowledge with a broad community. We do so by making code and resources publicly available whenever possible and attending conferences and talks to share our expertise.


### Self-actualization

To accommodate for different working styles and backgrounds, we do not prefer specific coding languages or technologies but rather encourage our partners and members to choose the right path for themselves, guiding them through their unique journey.


# Examples of how we strive to work



*   You work on a Data4Good project. An NPO representative asks you a question that you do not know the answer to. You politely explain that this is unfortunately not your area of expertise and offer to seek advice from the CorrelAid community. When the NPO representative agrees to share the information, you reach out to the network.
*   You work on a Data4Good project. One of the volunteers disappears and you are now understaffed. You contact the project lead who then aims at resolving the issue with the volunteer. If the issue persists, the project lead contacts the operational team to provide additional resources.
*   Together with other volunteers you organize an event in which NPOs can propose their data challenges and our community can pitch solutions. One of the NPOs is not satisfied with the outcome. As one of the organizers you send an official apology to the official contact person, thank them for their feedback and take responsibility for what happened. You derive lessons learned and share them with the community. If additional resources become available, you offer more counselling to the affected partner NPO.
*   In the community, you joke around about a game you played and laugh about a situation that occured. A person that is affected by the situation does not seem to enjoy the conversation. You pull them aside and check in with them to make sure they are okay. When they tell you, they feel bad about it, you apologize, thank them for their honesty and ask how you can improve the situation. When they suggest you can stop to talk about the situation, you honor their will and, without exposing your confidant, politely cut mentions of the incident short, whenever they arise.
*   During a meeting, one of the members keeps cutting other community members off. You thank them for your input but also make clear that others should have the opportunity to contribute to the discussion without being interrupted.
*   You overhear another volunteer making discriminating comments about another volunteer in their absence. You may confront them privately and refer them to our Code of Conduct and/or seek counselling and report the incident to our responsible Ethics officer (see below).
*   You overhear another volunteer making discriminating comments about another volunteer in their presence. You interrupt the situation proactively by referring to our Code of Conduct and/or you seek counselling and report the incident to our responsible Ethics officer (see below).


# Scope of this agreement 

This agreement guides the work inside of our community and beyond. We care about following its principles closely in Data4Good projects, when representing our community and vision publicly and more generally when in any collaboration and communication with partners and other community members.
