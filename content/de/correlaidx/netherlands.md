Wij zijn een groep enthousiaste data scientists uit Nederland, en wij hebben Stichting CorrelAid Nederland opgezet.
We hebben als doel data scientists en maatschappelijke en sociaal denkende organisaties te verbinden.
Of je nou een student bent in een kwantitatieve richting en je wilt je skills inzetten in de praktijk of een professional en je wilt een betekenisvolle bijdrage leveren naast je werk; bij ons zijn data scientists van alle niveaus en achtergronden welkom.
Het werk is op vrijwillige basis.

Stichting CorrelAid Nederland is geïnspireerd door, en werkt samen met CorrelAid, opgericht in Duitsland.

Als je geïnteresseerd bent in CorrelAid Nederland of als je mee wilt doen: ga naar onze [website

During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an
orphanage in Kenya. Two years in, he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and
network to try to do good again once he had more experience. He has since then
worked as a data scientist at Capgemini, United Wardrobe, and Utelly, specializing in NLP,
Search, and Recommendation Systems. After seeing how much more impact we can
have with data, he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good.

Joel graduated from his master program in political science at University of Gothenburg in summer 2018.
Afterwards, he moved to Utrecht and started with several other passionate data scientists a local CorrelAid chapter in the Netherlands. Currently, he is living in Berlin. 
We are curious if we can transfer the concept of "data for good" on another cultural context and are excited for the first local chapter beyond Germany.
