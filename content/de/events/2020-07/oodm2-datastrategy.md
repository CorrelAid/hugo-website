For our second Open Online Data Meetup (OODM)*, we have an interesting talk for you. Sven Thies will share his experience setting up a data team, what he learned from it and why he thinks every company should first develop a good data strategy. The talk will be followed by a Q&A and a short discussion moderated by our host Frie from the CorrelAid core team.

We are looking forward to see you at the talk!

## The talk

Every company produces data. It enables companies to make better decisions and/or create better products, thus gaining an advantage over their competitors. However, understanding and using data is not an easy task. A lot of things can go wrong, especially when you don't have a highly experienced team, which as of today is not the case for many organizations. In this talk, I will sketch what went wrong when we set up a data team as unexperienced but highly motivated individuals at Traum-Ferienwohnungen and how we learned what we first would have needed: a good data strategy.
