Join the 4th Open Online Data Meetup (OODM) to hear three stories about you can make your data scientist life easier by automating things.

## The event
One of the biggest perks of learning programming is being able to automate things that you otherwise would have to do manually. This is also true for data science: Whether in data collection, data analysis, reporting or visualization: there is always potential for automation! In the fourth Open Online Data Meetup (OODM)*, Yannik, Alex and Frie share in three 10-minute talks how they have used their data science skills in combination with other technologies such as AWS or Raspberry Pi's to automate things away that otherwise would be very cumbersome and repetitive to do manually. After the talks, there will be room for questions and your experiences with automating things.

We are looking forward to see you at the event! :)

## The talks

### Using R and Datawrapper to automatically create charts for journalism

Yannik will show us how to create automated, interactive tables and charts that are ready to be embedded in a website using Datawrapper. He will introduce two R packages (one that helps to easily access weather data in Germany and one that allows to automatically update Datawrapper charts) and will show how to make a R script running on an AWS instance that finally does the job of automation.

### Automatically collecting rental bike locations with Python and AWS

Alex will talk about how she used uberspace, cronjobs and Python to successfully collect and store thousands of geolocations of rental bikes in a Postgres database not only once, but every four minutes over several weeks. She will also share several lessons that she learned along the way of collecting, storing, handling and cleaning such a large amount of data.


### Saving money with a Raspberry Pi and programming skills

Frie will take you back to 2017: She will talk about how - back when CorrelAid's financial resources were a bit more scarce - she used a Raspberry Pi, R and Python to hack around the limitations of the free Mailchimp plan to make sure that new newsletter subscribers would get a welcome mail. She will also show how she used that same setup to collect daily data on newsletter subscriber count, facebook likes and twitter followers and store it in a database.
